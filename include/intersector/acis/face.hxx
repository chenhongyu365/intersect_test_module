// Header for the FACE class.
// A face is a bounded portion of a geometric surface, the 2-dimensional
// analogue of a body.  The boundary of a face is represented by one or
// more loops of edges.  Each face is simply connected, implying that
// one can traverse from any point on the interior of the face to any
// other point on the interior of the face without crossing the boundary
// of the face.  In general, it is not meaningful to distinguish exterior
// and interior loops of edges, though for certain surface types this
// may be possible and some algorithms may do so.

// Face "loops" need not necessarily be closed, and if not, either
// open end may be finite or infinite.  If either end is infinite, then
// the face is infinite; if either end is finite, then the face is
// "incompletely-bounded", or just "incomplete".  Although such faces
// can be represented in ACIS, most algorithms cannot handle such faces.

 * <b>Role:</b> A face is a bounded portion of a single geometric surface,
 * the two-dimensional analog of a body. The boundary is represented by one or
 * more loops or edges. Each face is simply connected, implying that one can
 * traverse from any point on the interior of the face to any other point on the
 * interior of the face without crossing the boundary of the face. In general, it
 * is not meaningful to distinguish exterior and interior loops of edges, though
 * for certain surface types this may be possible and some algorithms may do so.
 * <br><br>
 * Face loops need not necessarily be closed, and if not, either open end may be
 * finite or infinite. If either end is infinite, then the face is infinite; if
 * either end is finite, then the face is "incompletely-bounded", or just
 * "incomplete." Although such faces can be represented in ACIS, most algorithms
 * cannot handle such faces.
 * <br><br>
 * Users may find the topological traversal functions located in <tt>query.hxx</tt>
 * useful for generating lists of faces on other topological entities or lists of
 * edges and vertices on faces. The <tt>get_face_box</tt> function may be useful
 * to retrieve or recalculate a face's bounding box. The <tt>reset_boxes</tt>
