/**
 * Tolerizes an entity as needed.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API finds all the edges and vertices in a part which have gaps larger
 * than <tt>SPAresabs</tt> and converts them into tolerant entities.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>opts</tt> object allows you to remap pointers, that is, to
 * look up the pointer to the tolerant vertex or edge that replaced
 * a given vertex or edge. This is necessary because when an edge or vertex is converted
 * into a tolerant entity, any pointers to it become stale.
 * <br><br>
 * It may be desirable to limit the size of gaps which will be filled in by tolerization; for example,
 * if some edge or vertex has a gap larger than the width of the model. The @href set_max_gap
 * method of the options object allows you to do this. If an edge or a vertex has a gap
 * exceeding the maximum gap, the <tt>outcome</tt> returned by the API will have its <tt>proceeded_after_errors</tt> 
 * flag set, and the <tt>error_info_list</tt> will contain information about which entities this happened to.
 * <br><br>
 * You may elect to repair <tt>TEDGEs</tt> after tolerizing by using the @href set_do_tedge_repair 
 * method of the @href tolerize_entity_opts object.  If tedge repair fails, the tedge involved will
 * be reported in the API outcome.
 * <br><br>
 * The API has failsafe behavior; that is, if it does not tolerize entities with gaps larger
 * than <tt>max_gap</tt>, or fails to repair a tedge, bulletin board rollback does not occur.
 * <br><br>
 * The API is able to check that tvertex and tedge tolerances exceed the gaps, but
 * this may have a negative performance impact. By default, the API ignores gaps on
 * tolerant vertices and edges. The @href set_ignore_tentities method of the options object
 * allows you to change this.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations</b>: The output data in the options object is
 * cleared each time the API is called.
 * <br>
 * If there is an edge in the input model such that the
 * start and end vertices are separated by less distance
 * than the gap attached to the vertices, a model with
 * overlapping tvertices will occur.
