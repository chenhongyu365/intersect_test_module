// Routine to cover a circuit of connected edges.  It adds a
// new coedge to each edge (unless the edge is a wire when the
// existing loopless coedge is used - and may be reversed) and
// places each new coedge in a loop, newly made, which is returned.
// Orients coedges forward along the sequence of edges and checks
// that the given edges are connected.

DECL_COVR LOOP* cover_circuit(ENTITY_LIST&);

// Routine to cover a collection of circuits of connected edges.
// It makes a new loop for each circuit and places the new loops
// into a new face.  If the pointer to a (lower_case) surface
// is not NULL, makes an upper-case surface and sets it in
// the face with sense FORWARD.  All edges must belong to one
// body.  The new face is added to the first shell of the body.
// The routine may be used to cover wire or sheet bodies a face
// at a time or to make internal faces for cellular bodies.

DECL_COVR void cover_circuits(int, ENTITY_LIST*[], surface const*, ENTITY_LIST&);

//	Routine to find and cover all simple circuits of external
//	edges of a sheet.  Returns an entity list of new faces
//	made (will be empty if no new faces are made).  New faces
//	will have no surfaces if none can be found to fit their edges
//	and vertices.
//	If surface found or given is planar, re-arranges loops into
//	connected faces.
//	NB: Does not cover wire edges.
