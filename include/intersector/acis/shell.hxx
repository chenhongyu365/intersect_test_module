// Header for the SHELL class.
// The shell is a connected portion of a lump's boundary.  It has no
// physical or topological connection with any other shell.  (The latter
// imples that one can not traverse the topological structure of one
// shell and end up on another shell.) If a lump has no voids, then
// exactly one shell gives its overall extent; any other shells bound
// voids wholly within the lump.  There is no distinction made in the
// data structure between peripheral and void shells.  In this
// context a shell is closed and bounded.

// It is technically possible for a shell to be open and bounded,
// or unbounded.  In the former case, the containing lump (and body)
// is said to be "incomplete" (or, more accurately "incompletely
// bounded").  It interacts with other bodies only insofar as the
// defined portions of their shells interact, and there are
// configurations of that interaction which are disallowed.  If the
// shell is unbounded, it may be semi-infinite (for example a plane
// bounded by a single infinite straight line) or infinite (two such
// half-infinite planes joined at their boundaries).  In the former
// case, again the body is "incomplete", while in the latter case it
// is completely defined, though of infinite extent.  Although it
// is possible to represent such incomplete lumps and bodies, most
// algorithms in ACIS do not operate on such entities.

// The concepts of "peripheral" and "void" shells, and of "connected"
// and "disjoint" bodies, have no meaning when applied to incomplete
// lumps or bodies.

// A shell is constructed from a collection of "faces" and "wires".
// This collection, if large, may be subdivided into a hierarchy of
// "subshells", each containing a proper subcollection.  A shell
// subdivided into subshells may also contain faces and wires directly;
// in this case, these entities are not contained in any subshell.
