// Header for ELLIPSE.
// An ELLIPSE is defined by an ellipse which in turn is given by
// a centre, a unit SPAvector for the direction of the normal to the
// plane of the ellipse, a SPAvector giving size and direction of
// the major axis, and a real giving the eccentricity of
// the ellipse i.e. length minor-axis/length major-axis (defaults to
// 1.0 for a circle).  The inherent direction
// of the ellipse is given by the normal (using right-hand screw rule).

/**
 * Defines an ellipse as an object in the model.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>ELLIPSE</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a
 * (lowercase) ellipse, the corresponding construction geometry class. In general,
 * a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent
 * model object. It provides model management functionality, in addition to the
 * geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>ELLIPSE</tt> is one of several classes derived from <tt>CURVE</tt> to define a specific
 * type of curve. The ellipse class defines an ellipse by its center, a unit normal
 * vector, a major-axis vector, and a double specifying the eccentricity ratio of the ellipse.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>CURVE</tt> and <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>ELLIPSE</tt> has member methods
 * to provide access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, methods are
 * available to set and retrieve the axes, center, and other information about an ellipse.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to an <tt>ELLIPSE</tt>. The construction of a new
 * <tt>ELLIPSE</tt> initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement
 * the use count, and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
