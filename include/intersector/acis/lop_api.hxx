 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Replaces surfaces of supplied faces with supplied surfaces, 
 * taking the supplied reverse flags into consideration.
 * Choose reverse flags carefully, as resulting body is not checked. 
 * Tweak will replace the original surface(s) with the user-supplied tool surface(s). 
 * The reverse bit depends only on the relationship between the corresponding surfaces. 
 * It does not depend on the face sense of the tweak face(s). If the reverse bit is set to TRUE,
 * then the FACE sense is switched; otherwise, it stays the same.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>box_low</tt> and <tt>box_high</tt> arguments are used to limit any geometrical intersections
 * and so improve performance.
 * Limiting the intersection improves performance.
 * The box must contain the final faces and if omitted, defaults to the size box.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Topology Changes:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The topology changes performed by <tt>tweak_faces</tt> on the tweaked faces and their neighbors are:
 * <br><br>
 * Mergeable edges and vertices on the supplied faces will be merged out.
 * <br><br>
 * Edges and vertices between faces that are tweaked to the same geometry will also be merged out.
 * <br><br>
 * Two edge vertices on the supplied faces between edges on the same geometrical non-analytic intersection curve,
 * which are not presently mergeable elsewhere, will be merged out by <tt>lop:tweak-faces</tt> 
 * if the option <tt>lop_merge_vertex</tt> is set on, which is the default setting.
 * <br><br>
 * Vertices with more than three edges may split into two or more vertices during a local operation.
 * Single inverted faces, needed to fill any gap in the body, will be made (if two or more inverted faces 
 * are needed, the operation will fail).
 * <br><br>
 * Isolated single edge loops may degenerate exactly to a point or be removed altogether, and their faces
 * will be deleted when appropriate.
 * <br><br>
 * Edges in multi-edge loops may degenerate exactly to a point and will be removed.
 * <br><br>
 * Where an edge exactly degenerates to a point in a multi-edge loop, the edges either side will be 
 * detected becoming fully or partially coincident, and the loop repaired by splitting it into valid 
 * and degenerate loops. Degenerate loops will be deleted, and their faces when appropriate.
 * <br><br>
 * When faces have been deleted, their shells and lumps will be repartitioned and split, if necessary.
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>lop_ff_int</tt> switches on face-face intersection checking on the result body.
 * The default for the option is off.
 * If the option is switched on and a face-face intersection is found in the body, the operation fails.
 * <br><br>
 * The self intersecting bodies repair is controlled by the @href lop_options class. It is enabled by default.

 * in the supplied faces and their neighbors if the option <tt>lop_convert_pipe</tt> is set on, 
 * which is the default setting.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Errors:</b> Some of the following errors will return a <tt>standard_error_info</tt> object 
 * in the API <tt>outcome</tt>.
 * In these cases, the type of <tt>ENTITY</tt> returned, in parentheses, follows the error message below.

 * Tapers each given face about the intersection between the surface underlying the face
 * and a given plane by a given draft angle.
 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Taper Faces](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/t/a/p/Taper_Local_Operations_Functionality_3214.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The purpose of plane taper is to facilitate extraction from a mold rather 
 * than changing the general appearance of a model.
 * So typically the draft angle supplied (specified in radians) would be quite small.
 * <br><br>
 * This local operation replaces the surfaces of supplied faces with new tapered surfaces. 
 * The new surfaces are defined by rotating the rulings along the draft direction on the 
 * supplied faces by the given draft angle about the intersection curve of the draft plane 
 * and the surfaces of the supplied faces.
 * <br><br>
 * From R11 onwards, the definition of the new surfaces made by the plane taper operation 
 * has been changed. They are defined as the envelope surfaces of cones, whose apices ride 
 * along the intersection curve of the respective faces and the taper plane, whose axes 
 * are specified by the taper plane normal, and whose half-angles are equal to the supplied 
 * draft angle.
 * <br><br>
 * Based upon this definition of the taper surface, it may be inferred that the interpretation 
 * of the supplied draft angle is different. In many cases, however, particularly when the 
 * taper surface normals are near orthogonal to the taper plane normal, the shape of the new 
 * surface will be similar to the old taper. Also note that if the <tt>AcisVersion</tt> supplied is
 * less than R11, the old taper surface will continue to be made.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the intersection between the draft plane and the given surfaces need not lie on 
 * the face to be tapered, and that even when it does, this intersection need not be an edge 
 * of the body (unlike in the command <tt>edge_taper_faces</tt>).
 * <br><br>
 * The taper operation on the faces is essentially determined by three arguments, the faces to 
 * be tapered, the taper plane, and the draft angle.
 * <br><br>
 * The faces to be tapered are given by the first two arguments which are the number of faces 
 * and the face array.
 * The draft plane is defined by the next two arguments which are a position on the plane 
 * and a vector defining its normal.
 * The draft angle is defined by the fifth argument, a double.
 * <br><br>
 * Whether the taper is executed or just validated, it is controlled by the option <tt>validate_lop</tt>.
 * One of its settings is <tt>lop_only</tt> in which the taper is executed.
 * When the option is set to <tt>validate_only</tt>, 
 * the taper is validated, and if validation fails, the 
 * faces which failed to validate are returned in the error return mechanism.
 * <br><br>
 * The default is <tt>validate_and_lop</tt> in which validation is carried out.
 * If the validation fails, faces are returned in the error return mechanism, and the 
 * taper is not attempted.
 * If the validation is successful, it is followed by the actual taper operation.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that successful validation is no guarantee of a successful taper.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>box_low</tt> and <tt>box_high</tt> arguments are used to limit any geometrical  
 * intersections and so improve performance.
 * The box must contain the final faces, and if omitted, defaults to the size box.
 * <br><br>
 * Vent face behavior is set through @href lop_options.
 * The argument <tt>vent_type</tt> is of the enumeration type <tt>vent_type_id</tt>. It can take 
 * either of the values <tt>vent_type_none</tt> or <tt>vent_type_add</tt>.
 * This API uses <tt>vent_type_add</tt> as a default behavior. An invalid argument to this parameter 
 * results in the default behavior.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>vent_type_none</tt> functionality is used as a different way of tapering. The functionality 
 * is added to handle the tapering without vent faces. 
 * <br><br>
 * When the faces shared by "vent edges" are tangential and one of the faces is a taper face and 
 * the other is a fixed face, one of the following can result:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>if <tt>vent_type_none</tt> is passed, the surface of the taper face is extended and 
 * intersected with the adjacent fixed face. This eliminates the need for the addition of vent faces.</li>
 * <li>if <tt>vent_type_add</tt> is passed, a vent face is added between the taper face and the fixed face.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Notes:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The input argument <i>draft_angle</i> is specified in radians with this API. However, the same input 
 * argument is specified in degrees with the Scheme interface <tt>lop:taper-faces</tt>.

/**
 * Tapers an array of faces about an array of corresponding edges and a supplied
 * draft direction by a given draft angle.
 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Taper Faces](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/t/a/p/Taper_Local_Operations_Functionality_3214.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The purpose of edge taper is to facilitate extraction from a mould rather 
 * than changing the general appearance of a model.
 * So typically the draft angle supplied would be quite small.
 * <br><br>
 * This local operation replaces the surfaces of supplied faces with new tapered surfaces. 
 * The new surfaces are defined by rotating the rulings along the draft direction on the 
 * supplied faces by the given draft angle about the corresponding edges.
 * From R11 onwards, the definition of the new surfaces made by the edge taper operation 
 * has been changed. They are defined as the envelope surfaces of cones, whose apices ride 
 * along the respective face edge curves, whose axes are given by the supplied draft angle,
 * and whose half-angles are equal to the supplied draft angle. Based upon this definition 
 * of the taper surface, it may be inferred that the interpretation of the supplied draft 
 * angle is different. In many cases however, particularly when the taper surface normals are
 * near orthogonal to the supplied draft direction, the shape of the new surface will be 
 * similar to the old taper. Also note that if the <tt>AcisVersion</tt> supplied is less 
 * than R11 the old taper surface will continue to be made.
 * Note that the corresponding edge must lie on the face to be tapered.
 * <br><br>
 * The taper operation on the faces is determined by the number of faces, the faces, the edges,
 * the draft direction and the draft angle.
 * <br><br>
 * If a face is to be tapered about several edges, these edges must all be supplied, which 
 * means that some faces may have to be supplied more than once.
 * This will lead to a topology change (see below).
 * <br><br>
 * The box low and high arguments are used to limit any geometrical intersections and so 
 * improve performance.
 * The box supplied must contain the final faces and if omitted defaults to the size box.
 * <br><br>
 * If the option <tt>"validate_lop"</tt> is changed to <tt>"validate_only"</tt> then 
 * <tt>api_edge_taper_faces</tt> does only a validation of the edge taper.
 * If the validation fails, the faces and edges which have caused it to fail are returned 
 * using the error return mechanism.
 * <br><br>
 * If the option is set to <tt>"validate_and_lop"</tt>, validation is carried out.
 * If the validation fails, edge and faces are returned in the error return mechanism, 
 * and the edge-taper is not attempted.
 * If the validation is successful, it is followed by the actual edge taper.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that successful validation is no guarantee of a successful edge-taper.
 * No validation is carried out with the final setting of the option, which is <tt>"lop_only"</tt>.
 * The default is <tt>"validate_and_lop"</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * Add vent face behavior is set through <tt>lop_options</tt> :
 * The argument <tt>vent_type</tt> is of the enumeration type <tt>vent_type_id</tt>. It can take
 * one of the following values: <tt>vent_type_none</tt>, <tt>vent_type_add</tt>.
 * This API uses <tt>vent_type_add</tt> as a default behavior. Invalid argument to this 
 * parameter will result in the default behavior.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>vent_type_none</tt> functionality is used as a different way of tapering. The 
 * functionality is added to handle the tapering without vent faces.
 * <br><br>
 * When the faces shared by "vent edges" are tangential and one of the faces is a taper face 
 * and the other is a fixed face, one of the following can result:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>if <tt>vent_type_none</tt> is passed, the surface of the taper face is extended and 
 * intersected with the adjacent fixed face. This eliminates the need for the addition of vent faces.</li>
 * <li>if <tt>vent_type_add</tt> is passed, a vent face is added between the taper face and the fixed face.</li>
 * </ul>

 * <br><br>
 * In addition to the following, refer to the topology changes listed for the function, @href api_tweak_faces
 * <br><br>
 * If a face is being tapered about more than one edge, a new edge will be introduced that splits 
 * the face into several bits (one per edge about which the original face is to be tapered).
 * <br><br>
 * Vent faces are added between mergeable faces, when one of them is not being tapered.
 * Vent faces can only be added if there is a face on the original model that shares a vertex with 
 * the mergeable edge, does not have the mergeable edge in its boundary, and that will be adjacent to 
 * the vent faces after the taper.
 * Vent faces can also be added at tangent edges when just one of the two faces that share the 
 * edge is being tapered.
