 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Sweeping with Options](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/s/w/e/Sweeping_with_Options_7371.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Provides a data structure for sweeping operations to be used in the function
 * <tt>api_sweep_with_options</tt>.
 * The options are described in the Technical Article <i>Sweeping with Options</i> and include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>bool_type</tt>: Specifies the Boolean operation to be used along with <tt>sweep_to_body</tt>
 *      or <tt>to_face</tt>. It is of type @href sweep_bool_type. Default value is <tt>LIMIT</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>close_to_axis</tt>: If a revolve operation is specified and the profile is an open wire that is not touching
 *      the rotation axis, it will close the gap(s) between the profile and the axis. 
 *      Default is <tt>FALSE</tt>. </li>
 *
 * <li> <tt>cut_end_off</tt>: Cuts the end of the swept body squarely, with a perpendicular plane to the end of
 *      the profile. Default is <tt>FALSE</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>draft_angle</tt>: Specifies the draft angle in radians. Default is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>draft_hole</tt>: Specifies the orientation of the draft angle in interior holes in faces being
 *      swept with draft. It is of type @href draft_hole_option. Default is <tt>AGAINST_PERIPHERY</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>draft_hole_angle</tt>: The interior loops of a face can be drafted with a different angle. Default
 *      is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>draft_law</tt>: The draft angle can be defined in the form of a law. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>draft_repair</tt>: Specifies the type of repairs done internally to complete a draft operation.
 *      It is of type @href draft_repair_level. Default value is <tt>DEGENERACY</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>end_draft_dist</tt>: Alternative way to set up a draft operation, by specifying the final
 *      offset distance. Default is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>gap_type</tt>: Specifies the type of face that will fill up the gaps made by draft operations.
 *      Its value may be: <tt>EXTENDED</tt>, <tt>ROUNDED</tt> or <tt>NATURAL</tt>. Default value is <tt>NATURAL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>keep_branches</tt>: Option to keep extra branches produced in <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> or <tt>to_face</tt> operations. 
 *      Default is <tt>FALSE</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>keep_law</tt>: The resulting graph of the <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> or <tt>to_face</tt> operations can be defined
 *      using a customized law. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>keep_start_face</tt>: Specify if in a closed path operation or a full revolution revolve operation
 *      the original profile face should remain topologically in the same place, instead of getting
 *      absorbed by the new closed body. Default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 *      <b>Note:</b> ACIS throws an exception error after calling @href api_del_entity
 *      if the <tt>keep_start_face</tt> option was enabled during a sweep operation of
 *      more than 360 degrees. In other words, sweeping 360 degrees causes the original face
 *      to become the "top" or "end" face, and automatically deletes the face entity
 *      before the next API call. Thus, when <tt>api_del_entity</tt> attempts to access the original
 *      face entity, ACIS discovers that the face was deleted and not "kept" as specified.
 *      This conflict in behavior generates an exception error. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>merge</tt>: The type of merge operation to be used. 
 *      It is of type @href merge_type. Default is <tt>merge_all</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>miter</tt>: The type of mitering operation to be used. 
 *      It is of type @href miter_type. Default is <tt>new_miter</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>miter_amount</tt>: Radius for <tt>bend_miter</tt> option. Default is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>portion</tt>: Specifies the portions of the path to be used. Default is <tt>ENTIRE_PATH</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>portion_end</tt>: Position perpendicular to the path that will indicate the end of the
 *      sweep operation along the path. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>portion_start</tt>: Position perpendicular to the path that indicates the beginning of the
 *      sweep operation along the path. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>rail_laws</tt>: Laws that define the rails (for orientation) for the operation. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>rail_num</tt>: Number of rail laws used. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>rigid</tt>: Specifies the orientation of the profile at miter planes or end of path. Default is <tt>FALSE</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>scale_law</tt>: Scaling along the sweep path can be defined in the form of a vector law.
 *      Scale should be uniform in the profile plane <tt>xy</tt> and unit scale along path tangent<tt>z</tt>.
 *      Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 *
 * <li> <tt>self_int_test</tt>: Specify if a self-intersecting surface check should be performed and if
 *      the body is allowed to complete even when a self-intersecting situation has been found. If set to 0, 
 *      the check will not be made and a body will be constructed; however, problems may appear during 
 *      subsequent modeling operations. If 2 is specified, the check will be performed, but it will notify 
 *      with a warning. Default is 1, which means an error will be thrown and a self-intersecting 
 *      body will not be constructed. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>simplify</tt>: Simplify when possible surfaces into lighter (analytic) forms. Default is <tt>TRUE</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>solid</tt>: The result body should be a closed solid body when possible. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>, 
 *      meaning the result should be a closed solid, unless the profile is a non-closed wire or edge. 
 *      If the intended result is a open solid body, the <tt>solid</tt> and <tt>two_sided</tt> options 
 *      should be set to <tt>FALSE</tt>. If the intended result is a open sheet body, the <tt>solid</tt> option
 *      should be set to <tt>FALSE</tt> and the <tt>two_sided</tt> option should be set to <tt>TRUE</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>start_draft_dist</tt>: Start offset distance used in draft operations. Default is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>steps</tt>: Number of linear divisions in revolve operations. Default is 0. 
 *      Converts a circular sweep path into the specified number of linear segments. 
 *      If the profile consists of linear segments, the results will be polygons.
 *      The intent is to create simpler surface geometry &ndash; possibly planar faces. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>sweep_angle</tt>: Revolve angle, in radians. Default is <tt>2.0*M_PI</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>sweep_to_body</tt>: Defines a body that will limit the sweep operation. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 *      <b>Note:</b> The <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> option and it is related options are mutually exclusive with the <tt>to_face</tt>
 *      option. The <tt>to_face</tt> option is used for backward compatibility. This option uses the surface of
 *      the face to locate the end of the sweep. It does not work with <tt>bool_type, keep_law</tt> or
 *      <tt>keep_branches</tt> options. These three options only work with the <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> option. The
 *      <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> option uses the entire body instead of just one surface. Combined with the
 *      related options, different parts of the resulting sweep will remain. If the <tt>to_face</tt> option is
 *      used, sweeping will unset the <tt>bool_type</tt>, <tt>keep_law</tt> and <tt>keep_branches</tt> options. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>to_face</tt>: Defines a surface that will limit the sweep operation. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>twist_angle</tt>: Defines an angle that the profile will twist by the end of the sweep operation,
 *      in radians. Default is 0.0. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>twist_law</tt>: Twist angle can be defined with a law. Default is <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>two_sided</tt>: If a open body is created, specifies it should consist of single-sided or double-sided faces. 
 *      Default is <tt>TRUE</tt>, for double-sided faces. An open body consisting of single-sided faces is an open solid body;
 *      an open body consisting of double-sided faces is a sheet body. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <tt>which_side</tt>: Specifies which side of a "back-to-back face sheet" to sweep. This is old functionality, not
 *      meaningful anymore. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Note:</b> In general, the <tt>get_</tt> methods do not increment use counts or return copies of objects; therefore,
 * what they return should be treated as read-only; however, the <tt>get_</tt> methods that return a law <i>do</i> increment
 * the use count of the law. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> If the <tt>rail_law</tt> array were set up using <tt>api_make_rails</tt> and it included a
 * twist law, then <tt>rail_law</tt> option would be mutually exclusive with the <tt>twist_law</tt> option. In other words,
 * do not specify the <tt>twist_law</tt> option.
