// Abstract class from which customers derive wrappers for their objects which manage a model's entities.
/**
 * Interface class to wrap customer "part model" and "assembly model" objects.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Provides an interface for messages between the ACIS Assembly Modeling and customer 
 * part management system.
 * <br><br>
 * This is the base class from which customers may derive their own entity manager objects. 
 * It is assumed that customers who are not using the ACIS part manager will have their own objects 
 * that manage the entities within a part. The asm_model_entity_mgr class provides an interface for 
 * assembly modeling to query the customer "part" objects and to pass messages (such as 
 * activate/deactivate) to them. The mechanism for this is for the customer to derive a sub-class 
 * of <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> that wraps a customer "part" object, and implement the virtual
 * query and notification methods. Each entity manager object in memory has a corresponding 
 * <tt>asm_model</tt> object. Spatial provides four standard subclasses of <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt>:
 * <br><br>
 * <b><tt>default_entity_mgr</tt>:</b> This is a basic implementation for use during save and restore 
 * of assemblies by customers who have their own assembly modeling system, and so do not need to derive 
 * their own sub-class. It should <i>not</i> be used for actual part management.
 * <br><br>
 * <b><tt>acis_pm_entity_mgr</tt>:</b> This is a subclass of <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> that wraps 
 * an ACIS <tt>PART</tt> object, and is intended to be used by customers who are using the ACIS part 
 * manager. Customers may need to further derive from this class in order to (for example) interface 
 * with their rendering system.
 * <br><br>
 * <b><tt>acis_ha_part_entity_mgr</tt>:</b> This is a subclass of <tt>acis_pm_entity_mgr</tt> that is
 * intended to be used by customers who are using both the ACIS part manager and the HOOPS/ACIS bridge.  
 * It adds functionality that maintains the HOOPS scene graph corresponding to the assembly model.
 * Customers may need to further derive from this class in order to manage views of the model.
 * <br><br>
 * <b><tt>acis_scm_entity_mgr</tt>:</b> This is a subclass of <tt>acis_ha_part_entity_mgr</tt> that is 
 * used to interface with the ACIS Scheme Toolkit's rendering system. It adds view management to the 
 * capabilities of the <tt>acis_ha_part_entity_mgr</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * @see default_entity_mgr, acis_pm_entity_mgr, acis_ha_part_entity_mgr, acis_scm_entity_mgr, asm_model,

 * Asks a subclass to put itself into the "empty" state.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Subclasses <i>must</i> override this function.  
 * <br><br>
 * This routine is intended to ensure that all deletions to be done by this entity manager are 
 * done before static destruction. It will be called by <tt>unbind</tt>, as part of unbinding 
 * the entity mananager from its associated <tt>asm_model</tt> object.
 * <br><br>
 * This routine should delete all entities and history streams owned by the <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> 
 * subclass object, <i>including</i> the assembly (if any) and all backup copies of these objects 
 * owned by the object's history stream. Deleting entities is done by calling @href api_del_entity 
 * or @href api_del_entity_list; deleting backup copies is done by deleting delta states from the 
 * history stream.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the assembly entity is always owned by the <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object, 
 * and so must always be deleted by this routine.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the history stream and/or entities may be owned by the customer's entity management object 
 * (which is wrapped by the <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object) rather than by the 
 * <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object.  
 * Any such objects owned by the customer's entity management object need not be deleted by this 
 * routine; instead they may be deleted by the customer's entity management object, with the caveat 
 * that the customer must ensure that any delta states containing backup copies of entities owned by 
 * the <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object are deleted. Practically speaking, this means that
 * this routine should either call @href api_delete_history, <tt>delete_all_delta_states</tt> with a 
 * <tt>keep_stream</tt> flag of <tt>TRUE</tt>, or @href api_asm_prune_assembly_history if the
 * <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object has ever owned an assembly object, whether or not it 
 * has been deleted. Note that this will result in a side effect for other models whose entity managers 
 * share this one's history stream, namely that their history and entities will be deleted as well.
 * <br><br>
 * For the case of the <tt>acis_pm_entity_mgr</tt> supplied with
 * the ACIS Part Management component, the <tt>asm_model_entity_mgr</tt> subclass object referred to 
 * above is an <tt>acis_pm_entity_mgr</tt> object, while the customer's entity management object 
 * referred to above is the corresponding <tt>PART</tt> object. In that case, this routine
 * could be implemented by calling the <tt>PART::clear</tt> method, which deletes all entities and 
 * delta states associated with the <tt>PART</tt>.
 * For a more sophisticated example implementation using <tt>api_prune_history</tt>, refer to the 
 * actual implementation of <tt>acis_pm_entity_mgr::clear_vf</tt> in the example source files.
 * <br><br>
 * Entities should be deleted with @href api_del_entity_list.
 * <br><br>
 * History streams should be deleted with @href api_delete_history.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the entity manager destructor should <i>not</i> delete any entities, because 
 * it may be called during static destruction after the history streams have already been deleted.
 * <br><br>
 * This routine will <i>not</i> be called within a <tt>MODEL_BEGIN/MODEL_END</tt> block, so it is the 
 * subclass' responsibility to ensure that operations are performed in the correct history stream, 
 * to use <tt>API_BEGIN/API_END</tt> blocks where necessary,
