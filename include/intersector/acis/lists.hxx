/**
 * Implements a variable length list of entities with set and index behavior.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This class provides a constructor (which creates an empty list), a destructor (which returns used memory),
 * a function to add an entity if not already in the list (i.e. set behavior), a function to remove an entry (leaving a tombstone),
 * a function to look up an entity by pointer value or index, a function to count the number of entries in the list (including tombstones),
 * and a function to return the number of live entries in the list (iteration_count) excluding the tombstones.
 * Also provides an overloaded <tt>"[ ]"</tt> index operator for access by position.
 * <br><br>
 * The preferred way of accessing the data items is through <tt>ENTITY_LIST::init</tt> method, which rewinds the list;
 * and <tt>ENTITY_LIST::next</tt> method, which returns the next undeleted item. Using <tt>init</tt> and <tt>next</tt>
 * will avoid removed entries, i.e., tombstones.
 * <br><br>
 * The current implementation uses hashing. This results in efficient searching, inserting, and deleting of entries.
 * Furthermore, this data structure has been tuned so that it is efficient for both small lists and large lists,
 * as well as repeated lookups of the same entity.
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 * ENTITY_LIST my_face_list;
 * api_cover_sheet(sheet_body, new_surface,
 *  	my_face_list);
 * ENTITY* my_list_item
 * my_face_list.init();
 * while ((my_list_item=my_face_list.next()) != NULL){
 * 	if is_FACE(my_list_item){
 * 	.
 *	.
 * 	.
 * 	}
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * <b>Implementation Notes:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * An <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt> is not an <tt>ENTITY</tt>. Therefore, it cannot be saved to <tt>SAT/SAB</tt>,
 * nor can it "roll" within history.
 * <br><br>
 * If an <tt>ENITTY</tt> in added to the <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt> then subsequently lost, a stale pointer
 * will reside within the <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt>. In other words, the <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt> has no
 * knowledge of the lifetime of any of its entries.
 * <br><br>
 * Refer to the <tt>SPACOLLECTION</tt> entity if you need a container that stores a list of entities,
 * can be saved/restored, can roll through history, and has knowledge of the lifetime of its members.
 * <br><br>
 * Using the <tt>first</tt> and <tt>next</tt> methods will result in efficient list traversal
 * and will avoid tombstone entries. Using the array-operator to index entries is efficient for
 * front-to-back list traversal, but is less efficient when randomly accessing entries. Also,
 * indexing using the array-operator <i>will</i> return tombstone entries.
 * <br><br>
 * If you decide to use the array operator for indexing, you can detect tombstone entries by
 * comparing the returned pointer against the constant <tt>LIST_ENTRY_DELETED</tt> (-1).
 * <br><br>
 * To obtain the count of entries in the list minus tombstones, use the <tt>iteration_count</tt>
 * method. The <tt>count</tt> method will return the count of entries in the list including
 * tombstones.
