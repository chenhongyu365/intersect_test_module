* <br><br>
* If start stop angle or end stop angle values are specified, the edge blend is stopped and capped 
* with a stop plane at the given setback distance. This stop plane is constructed such that the angle 
* between stop plane and edge direction, about the line passing through end points of blend 
* cross section, is equal to the specified stop angle value at that end. 
* A stop angle value of 180 degrees is treated as a special case. In such a case, stop plane is 
* constructed such that it passes through an end vertex and end points of a blend cross section 
* at given setback distance.
* <br><br>
* <b>Limitations:</b> Entity-entity blends cannot create a stopped blend.

* <b>Role:</b> This API sets the attribute for a variable radius three face 
* blend. Use @href api_fix_blends to create the explicit blends. The blend surface 
* will be tangent to all three support faces. The cross section of the blend surface 
* is circular and the variable radius of the blend is driven by the requirements 
* of tangency to the surfaces. The blend begins on three of the specified support 
* faces and rolls onto the other faces in the same manner as a general 
* entity-entity blend. (Refer to the technical article <i>Entity-Entity Blends</i> 
* in the <i>Advanced Blending Component</i> of the Online Help.) The help 
* position and convexity are used to resolve ambiguous cases where more than one 
* solution would be possible. 
* <br><br>
* <b>Limitations:</b> <br>
* <ul>
* <li>All entities in the three support lists must be faces.</li> 
* <li>All faces must belong to the same body.</li>
* <li>The same face cannot be added to more than one support list.</li>
* <li><tt>find_smooth_bl</tt> is assumed to be true, and blend will propagate as far as possible.</li>
* <li>This API has the capability of generating singular spline blends,

* to the spring), then the blend surface will still be G2 continuous with its supports, 
* but only G1 with itself as it crosses the discontinuity.
