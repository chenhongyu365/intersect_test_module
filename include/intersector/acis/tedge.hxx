// Header for the TEDGE class.
// The tolerant edge class is a derived class of edge with a tolerace value.
// Unlike an edge, whose 3D representation is provided by its underlying
// curve, the 3D representation of a tedge is defined by the 3D geometry
// of its associated tcoedges.  The curve underlying a tedge is used purely
// for graphic visualization.
// The tolerance value of a tedge indicates the maximum distance between
// any two equiparametric positions on any of its tcoedges.
// Two tedges are coincident over an SPAinterval if the maximum of the minimum distance
// between the portion of their point sets bounded by the SPAinterval is
// less than the maximum of the tedge's tolerance values. If the tolerance value
// is less than SPAresabs, then SPAresabs is used for coincidence checking.
// A tedge and an edge are coincident over an SPAinterval if the maximum
// of the minimum distance between the portion of their point sets bounded
// by the SPAinterval is less than the maximum of the tedge's tolerance value
// and SPAresabs.
// A tedge with a single tcoedge will have a zero tolerance value.
// A tedge may only be associated with tcoedges.

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role</b>: The tolerant edge class is a derived class of <tt>EDGE</tt> with a tolerance value.
 * Unlike an edge, whose <tt>3D</tt> representation is provided by its underlying curve,
 * the <tt>3D</tt> representation of a <tt>TEDGE</tt> is defined by the <tt>3D</tt> geometry of its associated
 * <tt>TCOEDGEs</tt>. The curve underlying a tolerant edge is used purely for graphic visualization.
 * <br><br>
 * The tolerance value of a tolerant edge indicates the maximum distance between
 * any two equiparametric positions on any of its tolerant coedges. Two tolerant
 * edges are coincident over an interval if the maximum of the minimum distance
 * between the portion of their point sets bounded by the interval is less than
 * the maximum of the tolerant edge's tolerance values. If the tolerance value is
 * less than <tt>SPAresabs</tt>, then <tt>SPAresabs</tt> is used for coincidence checking.
 * <br><br>
 * A tolerant edge and an edge are coincident over an interval if the maximum of
 * the minimum distance between the portion of their point sets bounded by the
 * interval is less than the maximum of the tolerant edge's tolerance value and
 * <tt>SPAresabs</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * A tolerant edge with a single tolerant coedge will have a zero tolerance value.
 * A tolerant edge may only be associated with tolerant coedges.
 * <br><br>
 * This class is used as part of the tolerant modeling technology. It is not
 * intended to be created directly. Instead, it could be created as part of model
 * translation and healing. It permits an edge to be created and supported by <tt>ACIS</tt>
 * when the original data from translation or a corrupted model did not meet the
 * tighter tolerances of <tt>ACIS</tt>.
