 * Defines a straight line as an object in the model.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>STRAIGHT</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a
 * (lowercase) <tt>straight</tt>, the corresponding construction geometry class. In general,
 * a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent
 * model object. It provides model management functionality, in addition to the
 * geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>STRAIGHT</tt> is one of several classes derived from <tt>CURVE</tt> to define a specific type of
 * curve. The straight class defines an infinite line by a point (<tt>SPAposition</tt>) on the
 * line and its direction (<tt>SPAunit_vector</tt>).
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>CURVE</tt> and <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>STRAIGHT</tt> has member methods to
 * provide access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, methods are
 * available to set and retrieve the root point and direction of a line.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows references to multiple <tt>STRAIGHTs</tt>. The construction of a new <tt>STRAIGHT</tt>
 * initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement the use
 * count, and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
