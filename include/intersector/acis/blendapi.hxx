 * Creates explicit blends by making a new face to replace each implicitly blended edge and vertex, or by computing an entity-entity blend.

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Occurs when given a list of edges and vertices marked with
 * implicit blends, or a <tt>BODY</tt> is passed and there is an entity-entity blend
 * attribute on the body. The entities passed should be either edges and vertices,
 * or a body, not a mixture.
 * <br><br>
 * If the edges have similar blend types, the same convexity, and the same radius,
 * all edges that meet at an unblended vertex are blended. When edges with
 * different blend radii, convexity, and/or setback meet at a blended vertex, they
 * are blended. Edges with different blend radii, convexity, and/or setback that
 * meet smoothly (their adjoining faces meet at the edge with tangent %plane
 * continuity) at an unblended vertex, are blended.
 * <br><br>
 * If there are features lying inside the support region that is replaced
 * by blend, then blending attempts to retain those features. This behavior
 * can be controlled by the option <tt>bl_retain_features</tt>. However, if blending
 * fails to retain such features, then it will continue to give a result
 * that it is ignoring them. A <tt>sys_warning</tt> is raised when blending detects features
 * but is unable to retain them. This functionality is available only when this fix
 * API is called after the following implicit blend APIs: @href api_set_const_chamfers,
 * @href api_set_const_rounds, and @href api_set_var_blends.
 * <br><br>
 * Returns the blended edges and vertices of the graph in an entity list.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Errors:</b> An entity in list is not an <tt>EDGE</tt> or <tt>VERTEX</tt> or <tt>BODY</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> Blending a single edge cannot handle blends extending beyond the
 * adjacent face boundaries or stopped chamfers/rounds. Blending at a vertex where
 * two edges meet cannot handle blending of edges meeting with a discontinuity.
 * <br><br>
 * Blending at a vertex where three edges meet if there are mixed convexities, the
 * order in which blends are fixed is important. The edge with a different
 * convexity must be fixed first. For example. if there are two convex blend edges

// Chamfer one VERTEX of a solid, which has exactly 3 adjacent edges
/**
 * Creates a planar chamfer on a vertex of a solid body.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API creates a planar chamfer on a vertex of a solid body.
 * <br><br>
 * There are two distinct forms of the API. One is when offsets are the distances
 * along the edges, and additional edge and offset pairs are specifically defined
 * (and normal is not defined). In the second form, the chamfer %plane is
 * constructed to be perpendicular to the normal vector and the position of the
 * plane is determined by offsetting it from the vertex along the normal. In this
 * case, normal must be specified and no edges or additional offsets are defined.
 * <br><br>
 * In both forms, <tt>offset1</tt> can be defined as a negative value to create a concave
 * chamfer (when material is added to form a chamfer face). Conversely, a positive
 * <tt>offset1</tt> value provides no information about the chamfering type. For example, a
 * positive <tt>offset1</tt> can be used for removing material from convex vertices and
 * adding material to concave ones. Therefore, ACIS must detect the chamfering type.
 * When the vertex does not have adjacent edges, which is only possible with cones
 * and vortex tori, ACIS analyzes the face sense. For vertices with adjacent edges,
 * convexity of the edges is used to predict the chamfering type. If such a
 * prediction is impossible (e.g., a vertex with mixed-convexity edges) and <tt>offset1</tt>
 * is positive, a convex chamfer is assumed.
 * <br><br>
 * In the first form of this API, if the vertex is the apex of a cone, only the
 * first two arguments are used: a pointer to the vertex and the offset value. In
 * this case, the <tt>offset1</tt> specifies the radius of the sphere with the center at the
 * vertex, which intersects the cone to obtain the intersection %curve. This curve
 * is then used to find the location of the chamfer %plane (the chamfer %plane passes through
 * the intersection %curve).
 * <br><br>
 * If any edge touches the vertex, corresponding offsets specify either the
 * distance along the %straight line between the vertex and the point on the edge
 * (if <tt>distanceStraight</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, which is its default value) or the distance along
 * the edge (if <tt>distanceStraight</tt> is <tt>FALSE</tt>). The chamfer %plane is then placed so
 * that it passes through all these points. If the edges are straight,
 * <tt>distanceStraight</tt> does not matter.
 * <br><br>
 * The minimum number of required arguments is two: only the vertex and offset have
 * always to be specified. If the vertex is touched by several edges and only one
 * offset is specified, equal offsets are assumed for all edges.
 * <br><br>
 * If there are more than three edges touching the vertex and not all of the edge
 * pointers (<tt>edge1</tt>, <tt>edge2</tt>, and <tt>edge3</tt>) are specified in the argument list, all
 * offsets are assumed equal to <tt>offset1</tt> even if <tt>offset2</tt> and offset3 were specified,
 * and the three "best" edges are selected according to the following algorithm:
 * first, points are placed on all edges at offset1 from the vertex, and then three
 * such edges are selected so that they all have the same convexity (at the points
 * location) and whose points make the triangle with the largest perimeter.
 * <br><br>
 * In the form of this API with the normal specified, <tt>offset1</tt> means the offset of
 * the chamfer %plane from the vertex along the normal. This form allows for tilted
 * chamfers on vertices with no or one adjacent edge. If the normal supplied is a

/**
 * Creates a planar chamfer on a vertex of a solid body.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API creates a planar chamfer on a vertex of a solid body.
 * <br><br>
 * There are two distinct forms of the API. One is when offsets are the distances
 * along the edges, and additional edge and offset pairs are specifically defined
 * (and normal is not defined). In the second form, the chamfer %plane is
 * constructed to be perpendicular to the normal vector and the position of the
 * plane is determined by offsetting it from the vertex along the normal. In this
 * case, normal must be specified and no edges or additional offsets are defined.
 * <br><br>
 * In both forms, <tt>offset1</tt> can be defined as a negative value to create a concave
 * chamfer (when material is added to form a chamfer face). Conversely, a positive
 * <tt>offset1</tt> value provides no information about the chamfering type. For example, a
 * positive <tt>offset1</tt> can be used for removing material from convex vertices and
 * adding material to concave ones. Therefore, ACIS must detect the chamfering type.
 * When the vertex does not have adjacent edges, which is only possible with cones
 * and vortex tori, ACIS analyzes the face sense. For vertices with adjacent edges,
 * convexity of the edges is used to predict the chamfering type. If such a
 * prediction is impossible (e.g., a vertex with mixed-convexity edges) and <tt>offset1</tt>
 * is positive, a convex chamfer is assumed.
 * <br><br>
 * In the first form of this API, if the vertex is the apex of a cone, only the
 * first two arguments are used: a pointer to the vertex and the offset value. In
 * this case, the <tt>offset1</tt> specifies the radius of the sphere with the center at the
 * vertex, which intersects the cone to obtain the intersection %curve. This curve
 * is then used to find the location of the chamfer %plane (the chamfer %plane passes through
 * the intersection %curve).
 * <br><br>
 * If any edge touches the vertex, corresponding offsets specify either the
 * distance along the %straight line between the vertex and the point on the edge
 * (if <tt>distanceStraight</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, which is its default value) or the distance along
 * the edge (if <tt>distanceStraight</tt> is <tt>FALSE</tt>). The chamfer %plane is then placed so
 * that it passes through all these points. If the edges are straight,
 * <tt>distanceStraight</tt> does not matter.
 * <br><br>
 * The minimum number of required arguments is two: only the vertex and offset have
 * always to be specified. If the vertex is touched by several edges and only one
 * offset is specified, equal offsets are assumed for all edges.
 * <br><br>
 * If there are more than three edges touching the vertex and not all of the edge
 * pointers (<tt>edge1</tt>, <tt>edge2</tt>, and <tt>edge3</tt>) are specified in the argument list, all
 * offsets are assumed equal to <tt>offset1</tt> even if <tt>offset2</tt> and offset3 were specified,
 * and the three "best" edges are selected according to the following algorithm:
 * first, points are placed on all edges at offset1 from the vertex, and then three
 * such edges are selected so that they all have the same convexity (at the points
 * location) and whose points make the triangle with the largest perimeter.
 * <br><br>
 * In the form of this API with the normal specified, <tt>offset1</tt> means the offset of
 * the chamfer %plane from the vertex along the normal. This form allows for tilted
 * chamfers on vertices with no or one adjacent edge. If the normal supplied is a
 * zero vector, the face normal at the vertex is used.
 * <br><br>
 * The following code snippet illustrates a way to use this API.
 * <pre>

/**
 * Creates planar chamfers on vertices of a solid body.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API creates a flat on the given faces of a solid body. The
 * first argument, <tt>ptPosition</tt>, specifies a position in space which may lie on the
 * faces to be modified. It must lie on the faces if faces are not given, or may
 * not belong to any face. The offset, which may be positive or negative,
 * determines the offset of a chamfer %plane along its normal. The normal may be
 * given as the third argument. If the normal of the chamfer %plane is not specified,
 * it is found as an outward normal of the faces being chamfered at the position
 * nearest to <tt>ptPosition</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * If the normal is not specified, it is deduced from the other supplied parameters:
 * either faces or owner must be specified. If a body, owner, is specified, then
 * <tt>ptPosition</tt> must lie on one or more faces of the body. A point lying on multiple
 * faces belongs to the intersection of these faces. A list of faces to be
 * chamfered is then constructed. The normal is computed by averaging the
 * corresponding outward normals of each face in the faces array.
 * <br><br>
 * The sign of the second argument, <tt>offset</tt>, indicates whether the flat is to be
 * made by deleting the material (negative offset) from a convex face or by adding
 * the material to the concave face (positive offset). Note that this sign
 * convention is different from the one used in @href api_chamfer_vertex.
 * <br><br>
 * If the intersection of the chamfer %plane with the faces produces multiple
