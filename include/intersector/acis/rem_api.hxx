 *  <b>Role:</b> The array of EDGEs supplied to the API must all belong to the same WIRE body but do not have to connect. 
 * The functionality of the API will remove the EDGEs from the WIRE body and extend the neighboring EDGEs (naturally) and intersect

 * box as input. If an EDGE/EDGE intersection falls outside of the bounding box, then the API will, again, fail. If the API detects either
 * of these circumstances it leaves the body unchanged. If the intersection involves two identical curves such as straights, then a VERTEX
 * is placed between the two EDGEs based on an average distance.  
 * <br><br>
 * The API works on both open and closed WIRES. If an open WIRE is given and the EDGE to be removed is either of the EDGEs making up the
 * ends of the WIRE, the EDGE will simply be removed from the WIRE body. If the WIRE body contains only one EDGE and that EDGE is asked

*  <b>Role:</b> The input EDGEs supplied to the API must all belong to the same shell of a sheet body but do not have to connect.
* The API will remove the EDGEs from the sheet body and extend the neighboring EDGEs (naturally) and intersect them
* to close the gap. The API also takes a bounding box as input. The necessary intersections and extension of neighboring topology and geometry of input edges are limited by the size of the user supplied box.
* If the supplied box is smaller than desired, the intersection of neighboring EDGEs may fall outside the supplied box resulting in failure of operation.
* However, an overly large box will result in wasted computation. The box should account for body transform. SPAposition(0,0,0) can be used as default value for both box-low and box-high when user is unable to specify a valid box. 
* If a degenerate box is supplied, the API calculates the appropriate bounding box based on the owner body box and the neighboring edges of the input edges.
* The default box is twice the size of owner body box.
* <br><br>
* If the API fails to remove any input EDGE, it leaves the body unchanged. If the neighboring EDGEs involve two identical curves, then a VERTEX
* is placed between the two EDGEs based on an average distance.
* <br><br>
* The API has a failsafe behavior. When [careful](https://doc.spatial.com/articles/c/a/r/Option~Careful_bfde.html) option is FALSE, it attempts to remove as many input edges as possible. 
* The information about the encountered errors if any, can be obtained from the outcome object.
* When careful option is TRUE, the API will fail with the first remove failure.

* <b>Limitations:</b> The input edges can be free,prop or spur. They should not have non-manifold vertices.
* <br><br>
* Owner face or neighboring faces of input edges may shrink if necessary, but not so far as to let all edges between them degenerate to zero length.
* <br><br>
* Neighboring edges should extend and intersect. If the geometry of the neighboring EDGEs do not have a well-defined extension, this can cause the API to fail. 
* If they do not intersect, the API will fail. If a single edge is to be removed, then at least one of its neighboring edges incident on its start and end vertices should be free. 
* Similarly, if a group of connected edges are being removed, the at least one neighboring edge of the first and last edge to be removed must be free.
* <br><br>
* In order to retain spur and prop edges that are not part of the input edges list supplied to the API, attach NO_MERGE_ATTRIB to them, otherwise they may be removed by the API
