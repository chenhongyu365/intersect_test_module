 * <br>when nesting is on, this api expects co-planar wires. Non coplanar input wires with nesting on is not allowed.
 * <br>Covering is supported for three or four-sided non-planar loops, and for <i>n</i>-sided loops if all the edges lie on the same plane.
 * Loops with five or more non-planar edges are covered under the following conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Degenerate edges are not allowed.</li>
 * <li>Edges which meet at an angle &gt;= 180 or &lt;= 0 degrees are not allowed.</li>
 * <li>Edges which turn 'excessively' are not allowed.</li>
