/**
 * Defines a <tt>2D</tt> curve defined in the parameter space of a parametric surface.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The <tt>pcurve</tt> class represents parameter-space curves that map an interval of the
 * real line into a <tt>2D</tt> real vector space (parameter space). This mapping is continuous, and
 * one-to-one except possibly at the ends of the interval whose images may coincide. It is
 * differentiable twice, and the direction of the first derivative with respect to the parameter
 * is continuous. This direction is the positive sense of the curve.
 *<br><br>
 * A parameter-space curve is always associated with a surface, that maps the parameter-space
 * image into <tt>3D</tt> real space (object space); therefore, the two mappings together can be considered
 * to be a single mapping from a real interval into object space. Most of the properties of a
 * parameter-space curve relate in fact to this combined mapping.
 *<br><br>
 * If the two ends of the curve are different in object space, the curve is open. If they are the
 * same, it is closed. If the curve joins itself smoothly, the curve is periodic, with its period
 * being the length of the interval that it is primarily defined. A periodic curve is defined for
 * all parameter values, by adding a multiple of the period to the parameter value so the result
 * is within the definition interval, and evaluating the curve at that resultant parameter.
 * The point at the ends of the primary interval is known as the seam. If the surface is
 * periodic, a closed or periodic parameter-space curve cannot in fact be closed in parameter
 * space, but its end values can differ by the surface parameter period in one or both directions.
 *<br><br>
 * Also, a parameter-space curve is always associated with an object-space curve lying in (or
 * fitted to) the surface. This curve is used to assist in the determining of the surface
 * parameter values corresponding to object-space points on the <tt>3D</tt> curve, by using the parameter
 * value on the <tt>3D</tt> curve to evaluate the <tt>2D</tt> curve for an approximation to the surface parameter
 * values for iterative refinement. For this reason, a parameter-space curve must always have the
 * same parameter range as its associated object-space curve, and its internal parameterization
 * must be similar, though not necessarily identical, to that of the object-space curve. A
 * parameter-space curve can have the same sense as its associated object-space curve, or be
 * opposite. In the latter case, the parameterization is negated one to the other.
 *<br><br>
 * In general, it is not necessary to have u or v continuity between two pcurves on a periodic
 * face or on a singular face, because evaluation of a parameter value outside the parameter
 * range is mapped back into the evaluation range by adding or subtracting the period from the
 * parameter value to be evaluated (periodic face), or by adding or subtracting the parameter
 * value changes while the actual 3-space location is coincident (singular face).
 *<br><br>
 * In the case of a spline converted sphere,face 0 ranges from u = -pi/2 to pi/2 and v = 0 to pi;
 * face 1 ranges from u = -pi/2 to pi/2 and v = pi to 2*pi.
 * Coedges 0 and 2 belong to face 0, so their param ranges should match the corresponding face param ranges.
 * Coedge 0 has param values: u = -pi/2 to pi/2 and v = 0.
 * Coedge 2 has param values: u = pi/2 to -pi/2 and v = pi.
 * <br><br>
 * The param values are correct, because Coedge 0 travels from top vertex to bottom vertex, and
 * Coedge 2 travels from bottom vertex to top vertex on the sphere; as a result, u values are
 * continuous (-pi/2 to pi/2 and pi/2 to -pi/2) moving along Coedge 0, onto Coedge 2, and along Coedge 2.
 *<br> For the V direction (since face 0 is singular in v), v ranges from 0 to pi along
 * both singular poles of the hemispherical face, so v value may be any value between 0 and pi
 * for the given u param values, and should still evaluate to the same 3-space point; at
 * u = -pi/2 or u = pi/2, all v values map to (0, 0, 20) and (0, 0, -20) respectively. Since the
 * pcurves map to surface param values, they could use any value at endpoints. However, since pcurve 0 must travel along
 * entire edge of face 0, the v value must be pi along the entire length of pcurve 0 (only valid value at u values not
 * at singularity points in v). Similarly, pcurve 2 must have v value of 0 along entire length of pcurve 2.
 * Transition from pcurve 0 to pcurve 2 is, then, continuous in u, and discontinuous in v, but discontinuity in v matches
 * singularity in v at poles of hemispherical face 0; in addition, evaluation of any value of v (0 to pi) at poles gives
 * correct 3-space position. Similar discussion results if data for Coedge 1 and 3 is examined.
 *<br><br>
 * A pcurve consists of pointer to a <tt>par_cur</tt> that holds the data defining the <tt>2D</tt> parameter space
 * curve and a logical flag indicating reversal of the pcurve from the underlying spline curve.
 * In addition, a parameter space vector is stored that represents the displacement of this
 * pcurve in the parameter space of the surface the pcurve lies in. By having a nonzero vector
 * for a periodic surface, a continuous sequence of object space curves <tt>(3D curves)</tt> can have a
 * continuous sequence of parameter space curves <tt>(2D curves)</tt>.
 *<br><br>
 * The <tt>par_cur</tt> in turn consists of a pointer to a <tt>bs2_curve (a 2D spline curve)</tt>, a fitting
 * tolerance, and a pointer to the surface where the parameter space curve lies.
