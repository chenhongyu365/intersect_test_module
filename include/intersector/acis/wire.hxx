// Header for WIRE.
// A wire represents a connected collection of unembedded edges.
// It is owned by a body or a shell, the latter necessarily if the
// wire is attached to corners of faces in the shell, or if it is
// internal to a lump (which will own the shell). Isolated wires
// used to be owned by bodies, and may remain so, though they might
// logically go into a shell owned by a lump owned by the body.

// Usually each edge has one coedge, and the coedges are linked
// in circular lists around each vertex, using next and previous
// pointers according to which end of the coedge lies at the vertex.
// A wire returned when booleans are used to slice (imprint) one
// body with another, has two coedges per edge; the coedges bear
// attributes giving details of the intersections of the body
// boundaries at each edge.
