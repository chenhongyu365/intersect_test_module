 * In the case that a closed solid body is required, at least three distinct coedge lists must be

 * in the section list, the law imposes the take-off vector of the resulting %surface - superseding any %surface
 * constraint.
 * <br><br>
 * This overloaded version of <tt>api_loft_coedges</tt> accepts an array of guide curves in addition to the cross
 * section profiles. The guide curves "stretch" across the profiles from the first to last and add additional
 * control of the %surface in the <i>v</i> direction. If the tangent constraint and the guide %curve provide
 * conflicting directions, a <tt>skin_options</tt> is used to specify which constraint is preferred. (See @href skin_options and
 * the Technical Article on <i>Loft with Guides</i>.)

 * <br><br>
 * The guides are accepted as <tt>EDGEs</tt> never as wire bodies and the %curve underlying the guide must be C<sup>1</sup> continuous
 * and non-looping. In addition, the guide must touch each wire profile within <tt>SPAresfit</tt> and start and stop exactly
 * on the first and last profiles. Direction is not important. The guides can intersect the section profiles on or
 * off vertices. If the guide does not lie on any vertices no %surface edge is created. If the guide intersects the
 * first profile off a vertex but intersects any other profile on a vertex, a %surface edge is made. In addition to
 * accepting guides this overloaded API supporting guide curves takes the <tt>logical</tt> flag <tt>virtualGuides</tt>. This flag toggles
 * the guides from being local %surface control to global %surface control. For example, in the case of local %surface
 * control, the guide %curve only affects the %surface created from the edges of the wire that the guide intersects. In the
 * case of <tt>virtualGuides</tt> being <tt>TRUE</tt>, the guide affects all the surfaces made from the wire body cross sections.
 * <br><br>
 * Once the cross section data structures and guides have been established, the <tt>api_loft_coedges</tt> function
 * can be called. The <tt>api_loft_coedges</tt> function also accepts the @href skin_options class.
 * <br><br>
 * In the case that a closed solid body is required, at least three distinct coedge lists must be
 * provided. If the first and last coedge lists are identical, a closed solid loft body is
 * automatically constructed. The end tangency will depend on the laws specified at the first and
 * last profiles. If duplicate copies of the internal coedge lists are sent to <tt>api_loft_coedges</tt>,
 * the copies are ignored while producing the loft.
 * <br><br>
 * If the user provides a set of closed profiles, the face normals of the loft body point outside,

 * <br><br>

 * <br><br>
 * This overloadeded version of <tt>api_skin_wires</tt> is a hybrid operation of the two functional variations of skinning:
 * <i>Skinning with Vectors</i> and <i>Skinning with Guide Curves</i>. That is, it accepts both vectors and guides as %surface constraints.
 * <br><br>
 * To support the vector constraints this API accepts an array of vectors to control the take-off directions with which the skinned
 * %surface leaves the profiles. The number of supplied vectors must equal the number of profiles, if the <tt>closed</tt> option is set
 * to <tt>FALSE</tt>. If the <tt>closed</tt> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, one more vector can be given. It will be used on the copy that is made of
 * the first profile to create a closed body. If no additional vector is provided, the first vector will be used also on the first
 * profile's copy. A profile will be interpolated without constraint if the vector supplied for it is the the zero vector.
 * <br><br>
 * To support the guide constraints this API accepts an array of <tt>EDGEs</tt>. The %curve underlying the guide must be C<sup>1</sup> continuous
 * and non-looping. In addition, the guide must touch each wire profile within <tt>SPAresfit</tt> and START and STOP exactly
 * on the first and last profiles. Direction is not important. The guides can intersect the section profiles on or
 * off vertices. If the guide does not lie on any vertices, no %surface edge is created. If the guide intersects the
 * first profile off a vertex but intersects any other profile on a vertex, a %surface edge is made. In addition to
 * accepting guides this overloaded API supporting guide curves takes the <tt>logical</tt> flag <tt>virtualGuides</tt>. This flag toggles
 * the guides from being local %surface control to global %surface control. For example, in the case of local %surface
 * control, the guide %curve only affects the %surface created from the edges of the wire that the guide intersects. In the
 * case of <tt>virtualGuides</tt> being <tt>TRUE</tt>, the guide affects all the surfaces made from the wire body cross sections.
 * <br><br>
 * If the tangent constraint and the guide curves provide conflicting directions, a <tt>skin_options</tt> is used to specify
 * which constraint is preferred. (See @href skin_options and the technical article on <i>Loft With Guides</i>.) This API
 * also accepts the other skinning options avaliable in this class.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Errors:</b> A wire pointer in the array is <tt>NULL</tt> or not to a wire body.

 * <b>Limitations:</b> The wire bodies are assumed to be simple; that is, they must be well behaved and non-looping.

 * Branched skinning differs from all other forms of skinning in that it allows multiple lists of profiles to be skinned. The
 * first and second parameters pertain to the "trunk" of the skin. Although the order of cross sections is not important in regular
 * skinning, it is important here that the last cross section of the trunk be the section in which each of the branches will attach.
 * Parameters three, four and five pertain to the branches of the skin. Branched skinning can handle any number of branches but most
 * practical applications will only require a few. Like the trunk, the order of the cross sections in each branch is important. The
 * first cross section must be the section that attaches to the trunk.
 * <br><br>
 * Each branch and trunk must contain at least one profile.
 * <br><br>
 * In addition, this functional variant includes the enumerated type skinning_normals. It does not support degenerate end points.

 * "stretch" across the profiles from the first to last and control the %surface in the <i>v</i> direction. The guides are

 * If only two wires are given, one wire may be a degenerate line; that is, treated as a point. For example,

 * Creates a sheet body that interpolates a series of sections.

 * <b>Role:</b> This class interpolates a %surface through a network of bi-directional curves.

 * There must be at least four sections or bodies, two in each direction.
 * The start points of the curves in the <i>v</i> direction must lie on the first %curve in the <i>u</i> direction,

 * If all of the curves (sections) intersect, then the %surface passes through the curves and their

 * Creates an <tt>AcisLoftingInterface</tt> object.

 * <b>Technical Articles:</b> <i>[Lofting](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/l/o/f/Lofting.html)</i>, 
 * <i>[Skinning and Lofting Interactive Interface](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/s/k/i/Skinning_and_Lofting_Interactive_Interface_1561.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This object is used as the input to additional skinning and lofting breakup APIs.
 * It contains all the given input and residual data created via the lofting process.
 * <br><br>
 * Commonly, the <tt>api_create_li</tt> takes a data structure called <tt>Loft_Connected_Coedge_List</tt>.
 * This is composed of the number of coedges in the cross section, a pointer to the first coedge in
 * a list of coedges, the cross section orientation, the take-off vector, weight factor, and an array
 * of laws. Every cross section used in lofting has to have this data structure.
 * At the very minimum, two <tt>Loft_Connected_Coedge_List</tt> structures need to be created.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>api_create_li</tt> function accepts the following special options depending on the specific API:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li> The <i>arc_length</i> option is used to choose arc length or isoparametric parameterization of the
 * skinning surfaces. For isoparametric parameterization, the %surface parameter in the <i>v</i> direction
 * follows the cross section curves. For arc length parameterization, the %surface parameter follows
 * lines of constant length. The default is isoparametric parameterization. Surfaces resulting from
 * skinning with guide curves support isoparametric parameterization only.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>no_twist</i> option may be used to minimize the twist of the %surface produced.
 * Twist minimization aligns closed curves such that the start of the second %curve is aligned to the
 * start of the first %curve. Even if a body's shape is unaffected by twisting, a %surface with a twist
 * could produce unexpected results when faceting and rendering.The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>align</i> option is used to align the direction of the cross section curves such that the normal
 * of the first profile points towards the second profile. All other profiles are aligned to follow
 * the first and second. If the sections are not oriented in the same direction, the <i>align</i> option
 * should be used to avoid producing a twisted, self-intersecting body. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>perpendicular</i> option specifies the direction of the take-off vector, either perpendicular
 * to the coedge or in the loft direction. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt> (that is, in the loft direction).</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>simplify</i> option simplifies the %surface to a conical %surface, if applicable.
 * If all of the cross sections lie on a conical %surface (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, or torus),
 * the conical %surface is created instead.The <tt>SPAresabs</tt> variable is used to determine whether or not
 * the cross section lies on a conical %surface. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>closed</i> option may be used when the user needs to construct a solid body closed in <i>v</i>
 * (e.g., a %torus).A solid body will be constructed only when all the wires supplied are closed.
 * At least three profiles must be provided to create a closed body. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>solid</i> option may be used when a solid body is desired, but not a solid body closed in the <i>v</i> direction. 
 * When a solid body that is not closed in the <i>v</i> direction is desired, the end wires are capped with planar faces.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>periodic</i> option allows to construct loft bodies that are periodic in <i>v</i>; that is, bodies
 * that close back on themselves smoothly (continuously) at the start and end profiles.
 * As with the <i>closed</i> option, at least three profiles must be supplied to create a periodic loft body. 
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>virtualGuide</i> option my be used in order to have the user defined guides effect
 * the body in a global nature. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> When the <i>merge_wirecoedges</i> option is set to true, the G<sup>1</sup> vertices of the skinning and lofting
 * wire profiles are removed by merging adjacent coedges/edges. This improves operations such as
 * blending and shelling because it reduces the coedge/edge count and the number of surfaces and
 * eliminates near tangent edges. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> When the <i>estimate_loft_tanfacs</i> option is on, the weight factor for the tangency conditions
 * of the loft will be determined such that it minimizes the average radius of curvature of the
 * lofting surfaces. The resulting bodies should support shelling to greater thickness and also
 * blending of their edges to larger blend radii. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.</li>
 *
 * <li> The <i>match_vertices</i> option allows to suppress the vertex-matching-algorithm which ensures that
 * all profiles consist of the same number of coedges. A heuristic approach is used to determine
 * which vertex pairs are good matches.Profile coedges are then split where additional vertices
 * are needed. This option is forced to <tt>TRUE</tt> if the coedge numbers of the profiles are not equal.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * The algorithm that minimizes the %surface twist (see <i>no_twist</i> option) may add vertices to some
 * of the profiles if none of the existing vertices match well enough. The <i>no_new_twist_vertices</i>
 * option forces the algorithm to choose matching vertices from the existing vertices.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> The coedge lists are assumed to be simple; that is, they must be well behaved and
 * non-looping. The parameterization of the %surface in its <i>u</i> direction - the direction of the coedge
 * list - follows the parameterization of the curves underlying the coedges.
 * <br><br>
 * Lofting cannot produce a %surface in which there is any one point on the %surface in which the
 * <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> directions are the same or opposite. That is, in no case can an underlying %curve of the
 * user-defined wire body and a lateral edge of the %surface generated from the lofting algorithm
 * ever meet tangentially. (Lofting will toggle the <i>perpendicular</i> option for you to avoid this
 * condition.) End capping (for creation of open solid bodies) is supported only for planar end
 * profiles. If the end capping operation fails then the sheet body constructed is returned.

/**
 * Creates an <tt>AcisSkinningInterface</tt> object for either <i>Basic Skinning</i> or <i>Skinning with a Path</i>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This object is used as the input to additional skinning and lofting breakup APIs.
 * It contains all the given input and residual data created via the skinning process.
 * There are eight functional variations of skinning each differing by methods of %surface control;
 * however, only seven are supported through this API. Branched skinning is only supported through
 * <tt>api_skin_wires</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * For a complete overview refer to the <i>Skinning</i> Technical Article.
 * This API has the following variations: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic Skinning</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Vectors</li>
 * <li>Skinning with a Path</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Draft Angles</li>
 * <li>Skinning to the Planar Normal</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Guide Curves (or Virtual Guide Curves, if <tt>virtualGuides</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>)</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Ruled Surfaces</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * In all cases of skinning the cross section profiles are copies; that is, the originals remain.
 * The profiles can be either all open or all closed.
 * If the user provides a set of closed profiles, the face normals of the skin body point outside,
 * away from the body material. When the user provides a set of open profiles, the face normals of
 * the skin face are oriented along the %surface normals, and no attempt is made to change
 * the face normal orientation.
 * <br><br>
 * This overloaded version of <tt>api_create_si</tt> supports either <b>Basic Skinning</b> or <b>Skinning with a Path</b>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Basic Skinning</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Basic skinning accepts wire bodies as cross section profiles over which skinned surfaces are defined.
 * Basic skinning allows no control over the resulting surfaces other than the cross section profiles
 * themselves. (The <tt>path</tt> argument should be <tt>NULL</tt> for basic skinning.)
 * <br><br>
 * The profiles can either be all closed or all open loops. In the case of closed loops the end
 * profiles can be degenerate (a point). For example, basic skinning between a circle and a point
 * will give a conical spline with the "point" being the apex. The cross sections can be in the form
 * of wire bodies or edges; however, wire bodies are preferred.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning with a Path</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with a path accepts an additional wire body to control the take-off directions of
 * the %surface. The path is accepted as a wire body. It does not have to intersect the cross section
 * profiles. Skinning with a path accepts degenerate wires as end points; however, it is unlikely
 * that a desirable result will be produced.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Special Options</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>api_create_si</tt> function accepts the following special options depending on the specific API:
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>arc_length</i> option is used to choose arc length or isoparametric parameterization of the
 * skinning surfaces. For isoparametric parameterization, the %surface parameter in the <i>v</i> direction
 * follows the cross section curves. For arc length parameterization, the %surface parameter follows
 * lines of constant length. The default is isoparametric parameterization. Surfaces resulting from
 * skinning with guide curves support isoparametric parameterization only. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>no_twist</i> option may be used to minimize the twist of the %surface produced.
 * Twist minimization aligns closed curves such that the start of the second %curve is aligned to
 * the start of the first %curve. Even if a body's shape is unaffected by twisting, a %surface with
 * a twist could produce unexpected results when faceting and rendering. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>align</i> option is used to align the direction of the cross section curves such that the normal
 * of the first profile points towards the second profile. All other profiles are aligned to follow
 * the first and second. If the sections are not oriented in the same direction, the <i>align</i> option
 * should be used to avoid producing a twisted, self-intersecting body. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>simplify</i> option simplifies the %surface to a conical %surface, if applicable. If all of the
 * cross sections lie on a conical %surface (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, or torus), the conical
 * %surface is created instead. The <tt>SPAresabs</tt> variable is used to determine whether or not the cross
 * section lies on a conical %surface. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>closed</i> option may be used when the user needs to construct a solid body closed in <i>v</i>.
 * (e.g., a %torus). A solid body will be constructed only when all the wires supplied are closed.
 * At least three profiles must be provided to create a closed body. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <li> The <i>solid</i> option may be used when a solid body is desired, but not a solid body closed in the <i>v</i> direction. 
 * When a solid body that is not closed in the <i>v</i> direction is desired, the end wires are capped with planar faces.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>periodic</i> option allows the construction of loft bodies that are periodic in <i>v</i>; that is,
 * bodies that close back on themselves smoothly (continuously) at the start and end profiles.
 * As with the <i>closed</i> option, at least three profiles must be supplied to create a periodic loft body.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>virtualGuides</i> option may be used in order to have the user defined guides affect the body in a
 * global nature. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>merge_wirecoedges</i> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the G<sup>1</sup> vertices of the skinning and lofting
 * wire profiles are removed by merging adjacent coedges/edges. This improves operations such as
 * blending and shelling because it reduces the coedge/edge count and the number of surfaces, and
 * eliminates near tangent edges. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>estimate_loft_tanfacs</i> option is on, the weight factor for the tangency conditions of
 * the loft will be determined such that it minimizes the average radius of curvature of the lofting
 * surfaces. The resulting bodies should support shelling to greater thickness and also blending of
 * their edges to larger blend radii. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>match_vertices</i> option suppresses the vertex-matching-algorithm which ensures that all profiles
 * consist of the same number of coedges. A heuristic approach is used to determine which vertex pairs
 * are good matches. Profile coedges are then split where additional vertices are needed.
 * This option is forced to <tt>TRUE</tt> if the coedge numbers of the profiles are not equal.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The algorithm that minimizes the %surface twist (see <i>no_twist</i> option) may add vertices to some
 * of the profiles if none of the existing vertices match well enough. The <i>no_new_twist_vertices</i>
 * option allows to force the algorithm to choose matching vertices from the existing vertices.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> The cross section profiles are assumed to be simple; that is, they must be well
 * behaved and non-looping.
 * <br><br>
 * The parameterization of the %surface in its <i>u</i> direction - the direction of the user-defined wire
 * bodies - follows the parameterization of the curves underlying the wire bodies.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning cannot produce a %surface in which there is any one point on the %surface in which the
 * <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> directions are the same or opposite. That is, in no case can an underlying %curve of the
 * user-defined wire body and a lateral edge of the %surface generated from the skinning algorithm
 * ever meet tangentially.
 * <br><br>
 * End capping (for creation of open solid bodies) is supported only for planar end profiles.
 * If the end capping operation fails then the sheet body constructed is returned.

 * This overloaded version of <tt>api_create_si</tt> supports <b>Skinning with Draft Angles</b>.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with draft angles accepts two angles to control the take-off direction of the %surface

 * The draft angles are accepted in the form of radians. In addition to the angles themselves all
 * overloaded forms of this variation accept two more doubles to control the magnitude of the
 * draft angles. These values may be zero; in this case we calculate the optimum magnitude for you.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with draft angles allows the end profiles to be degenerate or single %straight lines.
 * In this case, the wire normal used in the calculation of the take-off direction will be computed
 * for you. However, if you wish to supply your own, there are two additional parameters that accept
 * normal vectors for the first and last profiles. These vectors are only accepted in the case where
 * the end profiles are degenerate or do not have their own intrinsic normal (i.e., %straight lines).
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with a draft does not support the <i>closed</i> or <i>periodic</i> options.

 * It contains all the given input and residual data created via the skinning process.
 * There are eight functional variations of skinning each differing by methods of %surface control;
 * however, only seven are supported through this API. Branched skinning is only supported through
 * <tt>api_skin_wires</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * For a complete overview refer to the <i>Skinning</i> Technical Article.
 * This API has the following variations: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic Skinning</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Vectors</li>
 * <li>Skinning with a Path</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Draft Angles</li>
 * <li>Skinning to the Planar Normal</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Guide Curves (or Virtual Guide Curves, if <tt>virtualGuides</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>)</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Ruled Surfaces</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * In all cases of skinning the cross section profiles are copies; that is, the originals remain.
 * The profiles can be either all open or all closed.
 * If the user provides a set of closed profiles, the face normals of the skin body point outside,
 * away from the body material. When the user provides a set of open profiles, the face normals of
 * the skin face are oriented along the %surface normals, and no attempt is made to change
 * the face normal orientation.
 * <br><br>
 * This overloaded version of <tt>api_create_si</tt> supports <b>Skinning to the Planar Normal</b>.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning to the planar normal accepts the enumerated type <tt>skinning_normals</tt> as the fourth parameter.
 * This enumerated type has four constants: <tt>first_normal</tt>, <tt>last_normal</tt>, <tt>ends_normal</tt> and
 * <tt>all_normal</tt>. This variation of skinning does not accept degenerate profiles (points) or profiles
 * that do not define a plane (lines). In addition, it does not accept any form of magnitude control
 * (see skinning with a draft angle). An optimum magnitude is calculated for you.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Special Options</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>api_create_si</tt> function accepts the following special options depending on the specific API:
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>arc_length</i> option is used to choose arc length or isoparametric parameterization of the
 * skinning surfaces. For isoparametric parameterization, the %surface parameter in the <i>v</i> direction
 * follows the cross section curves. For arc length parameterization, the %surface parameter follows
 * lines of constant length. The default is isoparametric parameterization. Surfaces resulting from
 * skinning with guide curves support isoparametric parameterization only. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>no_twist</i> option may be used to minimize the twist of the %surface produced.
 * Twist minimization aligns closed curves such that the start of the second %curve is aligned to
 * the start of the first %curve. Even if a body's shape is unaffected by twisting, a %surface with
 * a twist could produce unexpected results when faceting and rendering. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>align</i> option is used to align the direction of the cross section curves such that the normal
 * of the first profile points towards the second profile. All other profiles are aligned to follow
 * the first and second. If the sections are not oriented in the same direction, the <i>align</i> option
 * should be used to avoid producing a twisted, self-intersecting body. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>simplify</i> option simplifies the %surface to a conical %surface, if applicable. If all of the
 * cross sections lie on a conical %surface (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, or torus), the conical
 * %surface is created instead. The <tt>SPAresabs</tt> variable is used to determine whether or not the cross
 * section lies on a conical %surface. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>closed</i> option may be used when the user needs to construct a solid body closed in <i>v</i>.
 * (e.g., a %torus). A solid body will be constructed only when all the wires supplied are closed.
 * At least three profiles must be provided to create a closed body. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <li> The <i>solid</i> option may be used when a solid body is desired, but not a solid body closed in the <i>v</i> direction. 
 * When a solid body that is not closed in the <i>v</i> direction is desired, the end wires are capped with planar faces.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>periodic</i> option allows the construction of loft bodies that are periodic in <i>v</i>; that is,
 * bodies that close back on themselves smoothly (continuously) at the start and end profiles.
 * As for the <i>closed</i> option, at least three profiles must be supplied to create a periodic loft body.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>virtualGuide</i> option may be used in order to have the user defined guides affect the body in a
 * global nature. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>merge_wirecoedges</i> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the G<sup>1</sup> vertices of the skinning and lofting
 * wire profiles are removed by merging adjacent coedges/edges.This improves operations such as
 * blending and shelling because it reduces the coedge/edge count and the number of surfaces, and
 * eliminates near tangent edges. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>estimate_loft_tanfacs</i> option is on, the weight factor for the tangency conditions of
 * the loft will be determined such that it minimizes the average radius of curvature of the lofting
 * surfaces. The resulting bodies should support shelling to greater thickness and also blending of
 * their edges to larger blend radii. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>match_vertices</i> option suppresses the vertex-matching-algorithm which ensures that all profiles
 * consist of the same number of coedges. A heuristic approach is used to determine which vertex pairs
 * are good matches. Profile coedges are then split where additional vertices are needed.
 * This option is forced to <tt>TRUE</tt> if the coedge numbers of the profiles are not equal.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The algorithm that minimizes the %surface twist (see <i>no_twist</i> option) may add vertices to some
 * of the profiles if none of the existing vertices match well enough. The <i>no_new_twist_vertices</i>
 * option allows to force the algorithm to choose matching vertices from the existing vertices.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> The cross section profiles are assumed to be simple; that is, they must be well
 * behaved and non-looping.
 * <br><br>
 * The parameterization of the %surface in its <i>u</i> direction - the direction of the user-defined wire
 * bodies - follows the parameterization of the curves underlying the wire bodies.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning cannot produce a %surface in which there is any one point on the %surface in which the
 * <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> directions are the same or opposite. That is, in no case can an underlying %curve of the
 * user-defined wire body and a lateral edge of the %surface generated from the skinning algorithm
 * ever meet tangentially.
 * <br><br>
 * End capping (for creation of open solid bodies) is supported only for planar end profiles.
 * If the end capping operation fails then the sheet body constructed is returned.

 * Creates an <tt>AcisSkinningInterface</tt> object for <i>Skinning with Vectors</i>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This object is used as the input to additional skinning and lofting breakup APIs.
 * It contains all the given input and residual data created via the skinning process.
 * There are eight functional variations of skinning each differing by methods of %surface control;
 * however, only seven are supported through this API. Branched skinning is only %supported through
 * <tt>api_skin_wires</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * For a complete overview refer to the <i>Skinning</i> Technical Article.
 * This API has the following variations: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic Skinning</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Vectors</li>
 * <li>Skinning with a Path</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Draft Angles</li>
 * <li>Skinning to the Planar Normal</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Guide Curves (or Virtual Guide Curves, if <tt>virtualGuides</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>)</li>
 * <li>Skinning with Ruled Surfaces</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * In all cases of skinning the cross section profiles are copies; that is, the originals remain.
 * The profiles can be either all open or all closed.
 * If the user provides a set of closed profiles, the face normals of the skin body point outside,
 * away from the body material. When the user provides a set of open profiles, the face normals of
 * the skin face are oriented along the %surface normals, and no attempt is made to change
 * the face normal orientation.
 * <br><br>
 * This overloaded version of <tt>api_create_si</tt> supports <b>Skinning with Vectors</b>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Basic Skinning</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Basic skinning accepts wire bodies as cross section profiles over which skinned surfaces are defined.
 * Basic skinning allows no control over the resulting surfaces other than the cross section profiles
 * themselves. (The <tt>path</tt> argument should be <tt>NULL</tt> for basic skinning.)
 * <br><br>
 * The profiles can either be all closed or all open loops.In the case of closed loops the end
 * profiles can be degenerate (a point). For example, basic skinning between a circle and a point
 * will give a conical spline with the "point" being the apex. The cross sections can be in the form
 * of wire bodies or edges; however, wire bodies are preferred.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning with Vectors</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with vectors accepts as additional constraints an array of vectors and, optionally, 
 * an array of magnitudes to control the take-off vectors with which the skinned %surface leaves the profiles. 
 * The number of supplied vectors must equal the number of profiles, if the <tt>closed</tt> option 
 * is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>. If the <tt>closed</tt> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, one additional vector 
 * can be specified. It will be used on the copy that is made of the first profile to create a closed body. 
 * If no additional vector is provided, the first vector will be reused on the first profiles copy. 
 * In a similarly way, magnitudes can be provided. A profile will be interpolated without constraint 
 * if the vector supplied for it is the zero vector. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning with a Path</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with a path accepts an additional wire body to control the take-off directions of
 * the %surface. The path is accepted as a wire body. It does not have to intersect the cross section
 * profiles. Skinning with a path accepts degenerate wires as end points; however, it is unlikely
 * that a desirable result will be produced.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning with Guide Curves (Virtual Guides)</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with guide curves accepts a list of guides in addition to the cross section profiles.
 * In the case of this API the guides are accepted via the function: <tt>api_add_guide_curve_si</tt>.
 * The guide curves "stretch" across the profiles from the first to last and control the
 * %surface in the <i>v</i> direction.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning To the Planar Normal</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning to the planar normal accepts the enumerated type <tt>skinning_normals</tt> as the fourth parameter.
 * This enumerated type has four constants: <tt>first_normal</tt>, <tt>last_normal</tt>, <tt>ends_normal</tt> and
 * <tt>all_normal</tt>. This variation of skinning does not accept degenerate profiles (points) or profiles
 * that do not define a plane (lines). In addition, it does not accept any form of magnitude control
 * (see <i>Skinning with Draft Angles</i>). An optimum magnitude is calculated for you.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Skinning with Draft Angles</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with draft angles accepts two angles to control the take-off direction of the %surface
 * at the first and last profiles. The cross section wire list may contain any number of wires
 * (greater than two) however, the draft angles are only supplied to the first and last profiles.
 * The draft angles are accepted in the form of radians. In addition to the angles themselves all
 * overloaded forms of this variation accept two more doubles to control the magnitude of the
 * draft angles. These values may be zero; in this case we calculate the optimum magnitude for you.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with draft angles allows the end profiles to be degenerate or single %straight lines.
 * In this case, the wire normal used in the calculation of the take-off direction will be computed
 * for you. However, if you wish to supply your own, there are two additional parameters that accept
 * normal vectors for the first and last profiles. These vectors are only accepted in the case where
 * the end profiles are degenerate or do not have their own intrinsic normal (i.e., %straight lines).
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning with a draft does not support the <i>closed</i> or <i>periodic</i> options.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Ruled Skinning</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Ruled skinning accepts the enumerated type <tt>ruled_skinning</tt>.
 * This enumerated type has only one constant: <tt>ruled</tt>. 
 * This variation accepts degenerate end points.
 * In addition, it supports the <i>closed</i> option.
 * It does not detect self-intersections.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Special Options</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>api_create_si</tt> function accepts the following special options depending on the specific API:
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>arc_length</i> option is used to choose arc length or isoparametric parameterization of the
 * skinning surfaces. For isoparametric parameterization, the %surface parameter in the <i>v</i> direction
 * follows the cross section curves. For arc length parameterization, the %surface parameter follows
 * lines of constant length. The default is isoparametric parameterization. Surfaces resulting from
 * skinning with guide curves support isoparametric parameterization only. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>no_twist</i> option may be used to minimize the twist of the %surface produced.
 * Twist minimization aligns closed curves such that the start of the second %curve is aligned to
 * the start of the first %curve. Even if a body's shape is unaffected by twisting, a %surface with
 * a twist could produce unexpected results when faceting and rendering. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>align</i> option is used to align the direction of the cross section curves such that the normal
 * of the first profile points towards the second profile. All other profiles are aligned to follow
 * the first and second. If the sections are not oriented in the same direction, the <i>align</i> option
 * should be used to avoid producing a twisted, self-intersecting body. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>simplify</i> option simplifies the %surface to a conical %surface, if applicable. If all of the
 * cross sections lie on a conical %surface (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, or torus), the conical
 * %surface is created instead. The <tt>SPAresabs</tt> variable is used to determine whether or not the cross
 * section lies on a conical %surface. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>closed</i> option may be used when the user needs to construct a solid body closed in <i>v</i>.
 * (e.g., a %torus). A solid body will be constructed only when all the wires supplied are closed.
 * At least three profiles must be provided to create a closed body. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <li> The <i>solid</i> option may be used when a solid body is desired, but not a solid body closed in the <i>v</i> direction. 
 * When a solid body that is not closed in the <i>v</i> direction is desired, the end wires are capped with planar faces.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.</li>
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>periodic</i> option allows the construction of loft bodies that are periodic in <i>v</i>; that is,
 * bodies that close back on themselves smoothly (continuously) at the start and end profiles.
 * As for the <i>closed</i> option, at least three profiles must be supplied to create a periodic loft body.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>virtualGuide</i> option may be used in order to have the user defined guides affect the body in a
 * global nature. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>merge_wirecoedges</i> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the G<sup>1</sup> vertices of the skinning and lofting
 * wire profiles are removed by merging adjacent coedges/edges.This improves operations such as
 * blending and shelling because it reduces the coedge/edge count and the number of surfaces, and
 * eliminates near tangent edges. The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * When the <i>estimate_loft_tanfacs</i> option is on, the weight factor for the tangency conditions of
 * the loft will be determined such that it minimizes the average radius of curvature of the lofting
 * surfaces. The resulting bodies should support shelling to greater thickness and also blending of
 * their edges to larger blend radii. The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The <i>match_vertices</i> option suppresses the vertex-matching-algorithm which ensures that all profiles
 * consist of the same number of coedges. A heuristic approach is used to determine which vertex pairs
 * are good matches. Profile coedges are then split where additional vertices are needed.
 * This option is forced to <tt>TRUE</tt> if the coedge numbers of the profiles are not equal.
 * The default is <tt>TRUE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The algorithm that minimizes the %surface twist (see <i>no_twist</i> option) may add vertices to some
 * of the profiles if none of the existing vertices match well enough. The <i>no_new_twist_vertices</i>
 * option allows to force the algorithm to choose matching vertices from the existing vertices.
 * The default is <tt>FALSE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> The cross section profiles are assumed to be simple; that is, they must be well
 * behaved and non-looping.
 * <br><br>
 * The parameterization of the %surface in its <i>u</i> direction - the direction of the user-defined wire
 * bodies - follows the parameterization of the curves underlying the wire bodies.
 * <br><br>
 * Skinning cannot produce a %surface in which there is any one point on the %surface in which the
 * <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> directions are the same or opposite. That is, in no case can an underlying %curve of the
 * user-defined wire body and a lateral edge of the %surface generated from the skinning algorithm
 * ever meet tangentially.
 * <br><br>
 * End capping (for creation of open solid bodies) is supported only for planar end profiles.
 * If the end capping operation fails then the sheet body constructed is returned.
