/**
 * Determines the relationship of a position within a given face's surface.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This function returns the containment of a given point <b>on

 * <tt>point_inside_face</tt>, <tt>point_outside_face</tt>, <tt>point_boundary_face</tt>,
 * and <tt>point_unkown_face</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The transformation will be applied only if specified. Typically this is the
 * transformation from the body that contains the face.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>test_uv_guess</tt> argument provides additional help by providing a coordinate in
 * parametric space for an initial guess on where the position may lie. This may
 * help to improve the performance.
 * <br><br>
 * If a previous position is specified, a containment description must be provided
 * (<tt>point_inside_face</tt>, <tt>point_outside_face</tt>, <tt>point_boundary_face</tt> or
 * <tt>point_unkown_face</tt>). This position can help find the position containment on the
 * face at a faster rate. It is recomended to use a position that was previously
 * found using this function. If the previous position passed in is a <tt>NULL</tt> <tt>REF</tt> it
 * will call the other <tt>api_point_in_face</tt> function.
 * <br><br>
 * If <tt>api_point_in_face</tt> is called often on the same face, then setting <tt>use_cache</tt> to
 * <tt>TRUE</tt> will increase the performance. If <tt>api_point_in_face</tt> is called with the

 * the cached attribute information, but the <tt>use_cache</tt> flag is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, the
 * information will be ignored.
 * <br><br>
 * Cache size refers to how many levels of cache are used to store and search
 * previously found data. Default is 10.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> If the input point is not on the face's surface, the behavior of this
 * function is undefined. For performance reasons this is not trapped by the function, so
 * the api will not fail in this situation, but the relationship returned is not meaningful.

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API traverses the given entity's topological tree structure,
 * checking for bad data or invalidities along the way.  Any problems found are added
 * to an @href insanity_list and returned to the caller via the given pointer.  A NULL
 * @href insanity_list indicates that no errors have been found. 
 * <br><br>
 * Each object in the @href insanity_list represents a single problem with the input entity
 * identified by the Checker, specifying the severity of the problem, the particular
 * problem identified, and the entity exhibiting the problem. Note that as most
 * entities own other sub-entities, the entities returned in the list are typically
 * not the input entity. For information on how to access the information from an
 * @href insanity_list , please refer to the documentation for @href insanity_list and
 * @href insanity_data . 
 * <br><br>
 * Each problem returned by <tt>api_check_entity</tt> is classified as being of one of four
 * different severities: ERROR, WARNING, NOTE, and INFO. Refer to "Table 1" and "Table 2" 
 * in the <i>Types of Checks</i> Technical Article for information on the checks performed.
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>check_level</tt> controls the level of computational effort performed by the
 * Checker. The range of effective check levels is any integer multiple of 10,
 * between 10 and 70 inclusive; the default value is 20. Any other value is invalid,
 * and the behavior of the Checker may be unpredictable with an invalid check level.
 * <br><br>
 * Each check in the Checker is allocated a check level at which it becomes
 * effective, although some checks may be forced at a lower level with the use of an
 * option. The Checker performs all checks allocated to levels less than or equal to
 * the set <tt>check_level</tt>.
 * Therefore, level 10 is the fastest and least thorough, and
 * level 70 is the slowest and most thorough. It is not the case that higher-level
 * check errors are less serious than lower-level check errors. Please refer to the
 * <i>Types of Checks</i> Technical Article for more information.
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>show_warning_msg</tt> controls whether or not WARNING-severity checks are performed.
 * By default, this option is set to FALSE in release builds and TRUE in debug builds.
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>get_aux_msg</tt> controls whether or not auxiliary information
 * should be included for selected Checker problems. By default, this option is set
 * to TRUE. Generally, when available, auxiliary information contains parametric or
 * position data specifically relating to the problem. This information is available
 * in string form only, via the @href insanity_data#print_message method.
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>check_abort</tt> controls whether or not the Checker aborts after
 * the first problem is found.  By default, this option is set to FALSE.   
 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>check_fix</tt> controls whether or not the Checker should attempt
 * to repair selected problems. By default, this option is set to FALSE.  If the
 * <tt>check_fix</tt> option is switched on and a repairable problem is detected, the
 * repair is made and the problem is not reported.  Extreme caution is advised when
 * using this option. 
 * <br><br>
 * An example of the usage of this API, including the displaying of reported Checker
 * problems, can be found in <tt>scm/scmext/intr/chk_scm.cpp</tt>. Customers are
 * advised against including the ACIS checking functionality as part of their
 * modelling workflow.   Instead, the models should be checked on read-in, and
 * repaired before modelling commences.  Please refer to the section 
 * <i>ACIS Checker</i> for more information.
 * <br><br>
 * Each check problem has a unique integer ID, obtainable via the @href insanity_data#get_insane_id method . 
 * An internal description of the problem, in
 * the form of 
 * a string, is obtainable via the @href insanity_data#get_message method.  It is
 * not recommended that applications make use of the message strings, particularly
 * for determining workflow.  Instead, the unique integer IDs should be used.  For
 * ease of migration to future versions of ACIS, it is recommended that applications
 * use the corresponding ID macros, which can be found in <tt>insanity.err</tt>. 
 * <br><br>
 * Certain check problems may have further subclassification information, available
 * via the @href insanity_data#get_sub_category and @href
 * insanity_data#get_par_pos methods.  Currently, the only check problem that
 * supports such 
 * information is IRREG_SURF ("surface irregular").   For further information, please
 * refer to the documentation for @href insanity_sub_category . 
 * <br><br>
 * Tables of all checks performed, and the associated problems that may be reported,
 * can be found in the Technical Article on the ACIS Checker.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Errors:</b> <tt>given_entity</tt> is a NULL pointer.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Effect:</b> In normal use, does not change model, but derived data may be
 * computed and cached. If fixing options have been activated, model will be
 * modified, if and when fixes are applied. If unexpanded patterns exist, 
 * topological entities may be created.

 * problems (see checks listed below) and, if any problem entities are found they
 * are added to the <tt>problem_ents</tt> list that is returned to the caller. The results
 * of the check are written to the file defined by <tt>file_ptr</tt>, if provided, otherwise

 * The option <tt>get_aux_msg</tt> can be used to control the level of detail for the

 * <br><br>
 * The option <tt>show_warning_msg</tt> can be used to control whether less serious problems
 * that are classified as warnings rather than errors are returned or not. Note that the default
 * value for this option is different in debug and release builds. For release builds, it is
 * turned off by default (so only error-status problems are returned), but in debug builds it
 * is turned on by default (so all problems are returned).
 * <br><br>
 * The messages corresponding to the insanity information provided by this API
 * are available in the file <tt>insanity.err</tt>. The mechanism for this 
 * is similar to that of sys_error.
 * <br><br>
 * If the user wants to see the list of checks made when using either of the two
 * functions, add the following lines of code to your program:
 * <pre>
 * sanity_ctx& ctx = intersct_context()->sanity();
 * printf("\n");
 * printf( "checked:\n" );
 * printf( "%d lumps\n", ctx.lump_num );
 * printf( "%d shells\n", ctx.shell_num );
 * printf( "%d wires\n", ctx.wire_num );
 * printf( "%d faces\n", ctx.face_num );
 * printf( "%d loops\n", ctx.loop_num );
 * printf( "%d coedges\n", ctx.coedge_num );
 * printf( "%d edges\n", ctx.edge_num );
 * printf( "%d vertices\n", ctx.vertex_num );
 * if(ctx.law_num) printf( "%d law\n", ctx.law_num);</pre>
 * A sample output for the above code is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * checked:
 * 1 lumps
 * 1 shells
 * 0 wires
 * 3 faces
 * 3 loops
 * 6 coedges
 * 3 edges
 * 2 vertices</pre>
 * An example usage of this API can be found in <tt>intr/intr_scm/chk_scm.cxx</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The level of checking and the output reported are controlled by the options
 * <tt>check_level</tt> and <tt>check_output</tt>. If the <tt>check-level</tt> defined is not a multiple of
 * ten, it is treated as the next lowest valid number. Any number over 70 is equal
 * to 70. Entity checking is aborted after the first problem is found if the option
 * <tt>check_abort</tt> is on.
 * <br><br>
 * The valid check levels are:<br>
 * 10  = Fast error checks<br>
 * 20  = Level 10 checks plus slower error checks (Default)<br>
 * 30  = Level 20 checks plus curve and surface checks<br>
 * 40  = Level 30 checks plus fast warning checks<br>
 * 50  = Level 40 checks plus slower warning checks<br>
 * 60  = Level 50 checks plus slow edge convexity change point checks<br>
 * 70  = Level 60 checks plus face-face intersection checks

 * <i><b>Note:</b></i> Many of the errors with pcurves can be fixed by forcing the pcurves to be

 * Computes a bounding box containing the entities. 
 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Boxing](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/e/n/t/Entity_Boxing_22f9.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b>
 * This API computes a bounding box for an <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt>. If the <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> argument  
 * specifies a <tt>WCS</tt>, then the computation of the bounding box is relative to that <tt>WCS</tt>. The
 * tightness of the box is specified by setting the <tt>SPAboxing_mode</tt> in the <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The positions returned, <tt>min_pt</tt> and <tt>max_pt</tt>, are the 
 * corners of the bounding box. These positions are always relative to the model space 
 * specified. Care must be taken during the interpretation of the results. 
 * <br><br>
 * By default this API uses the universal <tt>WCS</tt> for the orientation and location 
 * of the bounding box. If the user wants further control of the orientation, location or 
 * type of bounding box, then a pointer to a <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> object must be provided. 
 * This object takes a <tt>WCS</tt> and a predefined enumerated type for the boxing mode 
 * (see @href SPAboxing_mode for further details).
 * <br><br>
 * Consider the following code example:
 * <pre>
 *   BODY*       block_0 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition pt_0(0,0,0);
 *   SPAposition pt_1(1,2,3);
 *
 *   outcome result = api_solid_block(pt_0, pt_1, block_0);
 *
 *   BODY*       block_1 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition pt_2(4,4,4);
 *   SPAposition pt_3(5,6,7);
 *
 *   result = api_solid_block(pt_2, pt_3, block_1);
 *
 *   ENTITY_LIST elist;
 *   elist.add( block_0 );
 *   elist.add( block_1 );
 *
 *   WCS*        wcs1 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition xpt(-1,0,0);
 *   SPAposition ypt(0,-1,0);
 *
 *   result = api_wcs_create(pt_0, xpt, ypt, wcs1);
 *      
 *   SPAposition        min_pt(0,0,0), max_pt(0,0,0);
 *   SPAboxing_options* box_opts = ACIS_NEW SPAboxing_options(wcs1, SPAboxing_tight);
 *
 *   result = api_get_entity_box(elist, min_pt, max_pt, box_opts);
 *
 *   ACIS_DELETE box_opts;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This code example creates two blocks. One with corners at (0, 0, 0) and (1, 2, 3), 
 * and the other with corners at (4, 4, 4) and (5, 6, 7). Both blocks are added to an entity 
 * list to ensure that an overall bounding box is calculated.
 * <br><br>
 * Additionally, in order to have further control of the calculated bounding box, this code 
 * creates a pointer to a <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> object. This object takes in a <tt>WCS</tt> 
 * (<tt>wcs1</tt>) that is model-space rotated about the <i>z</i>-axis by 180 degrees, and a 
 * <tt>SPAboxing_tight</tt> boxing mode. This pointer is subsequently passed in to the API.
 * <br><br>
 * The corners of the newly calculated bounding box are at (0, 0, 0) and (-5, -6, 7), which 
 * are relative to the specified <tt>wcs1</tt>. Furthermore, the extrema points are also 
 * relative to <tt>wcs1</tt>, and they are (-5, -6, 0) and (0, 0, 7). 
 * When these extrema points are mapped back to model space, they are (5, 6, 0) and (0, 0, 7).
 * <br><br>
 * Because the API computes the extrema relative to <tt>wcs1</tt> and returns the results
 * mapped back into model space, the returned positions are:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      min_pt = (5,6,0)
 *      max_pt = (0,0,7)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> This API is guaranteed to return the tightest bounding box on toroidal faces
 * by default. In order to obtain the tightest bounding box for spherical faces, this must be 
 * explicitly declared by setting the boxing mode to <tt>SPAboxing_tight</tt> in the 
 * <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> argument (see @href get_face_box for further details). 
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> object takes one of the several boxing modes available: 
 * <ul> 
 *      <li><tt>SPAboxing_tight</tt></li> 
 *      <li><tt>SPAboxing_loose</tt></li> 
 *      <li><tt>SPAboxing_quick</tt></li>

 * When these extrema points are mapped back to model space, they are (1, 2, 0) and (0, 0, 3).
 * <br><br>
 * Because the API computes the extrema relative to <tt>wcs1</tt> and returns the results

 *      max_pt = (0,0,3)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> This API is guaranteed to return the tightest bounding box on toroidal faces
 * by default. In order to obtain the tightest bounding box for spherical faces, this must be 
 * explicitly declared by setting the boxing mode to <tt>SPAboxing_tight</tt> in the 
 * <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> argument (see @href get_face_box for further details). 
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>SPAboxing_options</tt> object takes one of the several boxing modes available:

/**
 * Computes a bounding box containing the entities.
 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Boxing](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/e/n/t/Entity_Boxing_22f9.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b>
 * This API computes a bounding box of an <tt>ENTITY_LIST</tt>. If a <tt>WCS</tt> is specified, 
 * then the computation of the bounding box is relative to that <tt>WCS</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The positions returned, <tt>min_pt</tt> and <tt>max_pt</tt>, are the 
 * corners of the bounding box. These positions are always relative to the model space 
 * specified. Care must be taken during the interpretation of the results. 
 * <br><br>
 * Consider the following code example:
 * <pre>
 *   BODY*       block_0 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition pt_0(0,0,0);
 *   SPAposition pt_1(1,2,3);
 *
 *   outcome result = api_solid_block(pt_0, pt_1, block_0);
 *
 *   BODY*       block_1 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition pt_2(4,4,4);
 *   SPAposition pt_3(5,6,7);
 *
 *   result = api_solid_block(pt_2, pt_3, block_1);
 *
 *   ENTITY_LIST elist;
 *   elist.add( block_0 );
 *   elist.add( block_1 );
 *
 *   WCS*        wcs1 = NULL;
 *   SPAposition xpt(-1,0,0);
 *   SPAposition ypt(0,-1,0);
 *
 *   result = api_wcs_create(pt_0, xpt, ypt, wcs1);
 *
 *   SPAposition min_pt(0,0,0), max_pt(0,0,0);
 *   result = api_get_entity_box(elist, wcs1, min_pt, max_pt);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This code example creates two blocks. One with corners at (0, 0, 0) and (1, 2, 3), 
 * and the other with corners at (4, 4, 4) and (5, 6, 7). Both blocks are added to an entity 
 * list to ensure that an overall bounding box is calculated.
 * <br><br>
 * Additionally, it creates a <tt>WCS</tt> (<tt>wcs1</tt>) that is model-space rotated about the 
 * <i>z</i>-axis by 180 degrees.
 * <br><br>
 * The corners of the newly calculated bounding box are at (0, 0, 0) and (-5, -6, 7), which 
 * are relative to the specified <tt>wcs1</tt>. Furthermore, the extrema points are also 
 * relative to <tt>wcs1</tt>, and they are (-5, -6, 0) and (0, 0, 7). 
 * When these extrema points are mapped back to model space, they are (5, 6, 0) and (0, 0, 7).
 * <br><br>
 * Because the API computes the extrema relative to <tt>wcs1</tt> and returns the results
 * mapped back into model space, the returned positions are:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      min_pt = (5,6,0)
 *      max_pt = (0,0,7)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> This API is not guaranteed to return the tightest bounding box on toroidal
 * and spherical faces. A tighter face box may be explicitly requested by setting the flag 
 * <tt>tight_box</tt> to <tt>TRUE</tt>.
