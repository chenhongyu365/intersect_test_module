// Class to represent the convexity of a single point along an edge (or
// equivalent), but where we don't necessarily want to commit ourselves
// to a particular angular tolerance at this point. When we do want the
// verdict given a particular tolerance, we can "instantiate" this into
// an instance of the cvty class.

// When instantiated, the convexity values that can be produced for a
// single point are:

// convex - edge is convex at this point
// concave - edge is concave at this point
// tangent_convex - edge is smooth here, but 2nd order terms imply
// 		convex (i.e. both surfaces have convex curvature here)
// tangent_concave - smooth here, 2nd order terms imply concave
// tangent_inflect - smooth here, 2nd order terms imply one surface is
//		convex, the other concave, and curvatures are the same
// tangent_inflect_convex - as above, but the convex surface is more
// 		curved than the concave one
// tangent_inflect_concave - as above, but the concave surface is more
// 		curved
// knife - surfaces antiparallel here, could not tell from curvatures
// 	whether the "knife" is made of material or air
// knife_convex - a "knife" made of material
// knife_concave - a "knife" made of air
