/**
 * Performs a selective Boolean operation on two bodies.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The API function <tt>boolean_tube_body</tt> takes two bodies (<tt>blank</tt> and <tt>tube</tt>) as
 * input and calls the selective Booleans stage1 once and stage2 the
 * <tt>number_of_options</tt> times. Each time these selective Booleans are called this
 * function automatically sets up the subgraph from a set of options and start and
 * end conditions.
 * <br><br>
 * If you pass multiple options into <tt>api_boolean_tube_body</tt>, the results will be
 * found many times faster than calling it separately for each option. The number of bodies
 * returned in <tt>bodies</tt> equals the number of options. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Defining the type of operation (i.e., specifying the <tt>bool_type</tt>) using tube_options:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * There are 3 types of cells: "only from the blank", "only from the tool", and "from both".
 * <br><br>
 * There are 4 possible <tt>bool_types</tt>, <tt>UNITE</tt>, <tt>LIMIT</tt>, <tt>INTERSECT</tt>, and <tt>SUBTRACT</tt>:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <tt>UNITE</tt> operation deals with the cells "only from the tool", adding the
 * specified ones to the blank. </li>
 * <li>A <tt>LIMIT</tt> operation is the same as <tt>UNITE</tt> except that all cells from the
 * blank are discarded instead of kept.</li>
 * <li>An <tt>INTERSECT</tt> operation deals with cells "from both". Only the specified
 * cells are kept.</li>
 * <li>A <tt>SUBTRACT</tt> operation deals with cells "from both". Start with the blank
 * and subtract the specified cells.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * For example, given a variable <tt>opts</tt> of type <tt>tube_options</tt>, call: 
 * <tt>opts->set_bool_type(UNITE)</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Defining Laws using tube_options:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Laws are used to specify which subset of the possible cells your operation
 * should use. Laws are string expressions consisting of the main variable that
 * loops over all possible cell numbers (x1), some constants (X2, X3, X4, X5, X6,
 * and possibly more), and some operators and conditionals (=, !=, >, or, etc). For
 * shorthand, you can use x for x1, y for x2, and z for x3.
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>x1 (x) = order of this cell, or the independent variable.</li>
 * <li>x2 (y) = largest order in the component cell x belongs to.</li>
 * <li>x3 (z) = <tt>TRUE</tt> if from tool.</li>
 * <li>x4 = <tt>TRUE</tt> if from blank.</li>
 * <li>x5 = <tt>TRUE</tt> if start cell.</li>
 * <li>x6 = <tt>TRUE</tt> if end cell.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Example Laws:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Imagine a vertical tube cutting through the three legs of an extruded letter 'E',
 * where the tube also extends above the top leg and below the bottom leg. Let 'E'
 * be the blank, and the tube be the tool. Specify the top cell to be a start cell,
 * and the bottom cell to be the end cell, using the ordering techniques explained
 * below. There are now 4 possible cells that could be included in the unite
 * operation, numbered from top to bottom 0, 1, 2, and 3.
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>x1 iterates over the 4 cells, testing each one to see whether it should
 * be kept. In this case, it takes on numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3.</li>
 * <li>x2 is always 3, since 3 is the biggest possible number.</li>
 * <li>x3 is always <tt>TRUE</tt>, since we are doing a unite, and only cells from the
 * tool are considered.</li>
 * <li>x4 is always <tt>FALSE</tt>, since we are doing a unite, and no cells from the
 * blank are considered.</li>
 * <li>x5 is <tt>TRUE</tt> if x1 is 0.</li>
 * <li>x6 is <tt>TRUE</tt> if x1 is 3.</li>
 * <li>Thus, to specify all but the last cell, use:<br>
 * <tt>law* keep_law = NULL;</tt><br>
 * <tt>api_str_to_law("x!=x2", &keep_law)</tt><br>
 * <tt>opts->set_keep_law( keep_law );</tt><br>
 * <tt>keep_law->remove();</tt></li>
 * <li>To specify all start cells, substitute the second line with:<br>
 * <tt>api_str_to_law("x5", &keep_law)</tt></li>
 * <li>To keep the second and last cells, substitute the second line with:<br>
 * <tt>api_str_to_law("x=1 or x6", &keep_law)</tt></li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Defining Cell Numbers, or Ordering:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * To determine cell numbers, first pick start cells and end cells. This is done by
 * picking start positions and end positions, or start faces and end faces, which are
 * on the cells you want to pick. Start cells are all numbered zero. The shortest
 * paths from start cells to end cells are automatically found. Depending on the
 * operation type, non-relevant cells are discarded and the rest are given an
 * integral number based on the steps they are away from the start cell. Note that
 * multiple cells could share the same number.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Keep Branches:</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Cells that are not on any "shortest path" are considered "branch cells." You can
 * either keep them all or discard them all with the <tt>keep_branches</tt> flag, which
 * defaults to <tt>FALSE</tt>. To keep branch cells use: <tt>opts->set_keep_branches(TRUE)</tt>.
