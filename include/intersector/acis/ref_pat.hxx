 * This API may be successful in situations where @href api_pattern_apply_to_entity

 * astride one or more faces (<i>rail faces</i>).  It comes with limitations, however:
 * <br><br>
 * <dl>
 * <dd>
 * 1. Only linear and circular patterns, without reflection, are supported when the
 *    pattern runs along rail edges or faces;
 * </dd>
 * <dd>
 * 2. The transforms defining such patterns must be ordered in such a way that they
 *    represent <i>monotonic</i> translations or rotations.
 * </dd>
 * <dd>
 * 3. Rail edges and faces must be uninterrupted within the extent of the pattern.
 *    For example, it is not possible to pattern along colinear rail edges that are
 *    joined by a vertex, even when the edges are consistent with the applied pattern.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <br>
 * It is recommended that the user adopt this API rather than
 * @href api_pattern_apply_to_entity in cases where the full set of faces defining the
 * seed pattern element are available.  Internally, this API examines the input
 * and calls @href api_pattern_apply_to_entity on its own when doing so would more
 * likely be successful.
