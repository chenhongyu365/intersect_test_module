// Header for the COEDGE class.

// The coedge is closely related to an edge and provides room to
// store its relationships with adjacent edges and with superior owning
// entities.  (In some contexts, the coedge may be viewed as the use
// of an edge by a face or wire.)  The data structures formed by these
// relationships (stored as pointers) and their interpretation depends
// upon the nature of the owning entity.

// The normal case is when the associated edge is part of a well-formed,
// manifold, solid body shell, being adjacent to exactly two faces.
// There are two coedges, each associated with a loop in one of the
// faces (in principle the two faces could be the same, and even the
// loops could be the same).  All the coedges in each loop are linked
// into a doubly-linked circular list through the next and previous
// pointers, and the two coedges for each edge are linked through
// their partner pointers.

// There are several extensions possible to this simple arrangement.
// Firstly, a loop may not necessarily be closed, for either a
// partially-defined or infinite face boundary.  In this case, the
// next and previous lists are not circular, but terminate with NULL
// pointers.  Secondly, a shell may not be closed, and have "free"
// edges at its boundary.  For such edges, there is only one coedge,
// with a NULL partner pointer.

// A third extension is to non-manifold shells, in which more than
// two faces meet in an edge.  In this case, the partner pointers for
// the coedges (still one for each face) are linked in a circular list.

// Coedges on faces whose underlying geometry is a parametric surface
// must maintain a pointer to a pcurve, which represents the curve
// underlying the edge in the parameteric space of the surface.
// Coedges on analytic surfaces are not required to have pcurves.

// An entirely different owning entity is the wire.  An object may
// be a directed or undirect graph, made up of one or more disjoint
// wires, each of which is a collection of connected edges.  In this
// case, each edge has exactly one coedge and the coedges are linked
// in circular lists around each vertex, using next and previous
// pointers according to which end of the coedge lies at the vertex.
// The next or previous pointer of a coedge on an open edge may be
// set to itself, indicating that there is no next or previous coedge
// on this branch of the wire.

// Finally, a shell may be of mixed dimensionality, containing both
// faces and unembedded edges.  The unembedded edges are connected
// together in wires and belong to the shell. Where they meet
// faces of the shell the vertices have multiple edge pointers, one
// for each face group, and one for each wire attached.

/**
 * Relates <tt>EDGEs</tt> to adjacent <tt>EDGEs</tt> and to owning <tt>ENTITYs</tt>.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> A coedge is closely related to an edge. A coedge stores its relationships
 * with adjacent edges and with superior owning entities. (In some contexts, the coedge
 * may be viewed as the use of an edge by a face or wire.) The data structures formed by
 * these relationships (stored as pointers) and their interpretation depend upon the
 * nature of the owning entity.
 * <br><br>
 * The typical case is when the coedge's associated edge is part of a well-formed,
 * manifold, solid body shell and when that edge is adjacent to exactly two faces. This
 * results in two coedges, each associated with a loop in one of the faces. (In principle
 * the two faces could be the same, and even the loops could be the same.) All the coedges
 * in each loop are linked into a doubly-linked circular list using the next and previous
 * pointers. The two coedges for each edge are linked through their partner pointers.
 * <br><br>
 * Several deviations are possible from the typical case.
 * <br><br>
 * - A loop may not necessarily be closed for either a partially defined or infinite face
 * boundary. In this case, the next and previous lists are not circular, but terminate with
 * <tt>NULL</tt> pointers.
 * <br><br>
 * - A shell may not be closed and have "free" edges at its boundary. For such edges, there
 * is only one coedge with a <tt>NULL</tt> partner pointer.
 * Nonmanifold shells, where more than two faces meet in an edge, links the partner pointers
 * for the coedges (still one for each face) in a circular list.
 * <br><br>
 * - Coedges on faces whose underlying geometry is a parametric surface must maintain a pointer
 * to a pcurve, which represents the curve underlying the edge in the parametric space of the
 * surface. Coedges on analytic surfaces are not required to have pcurves.
 * <br><br>
 * - Wires as owning entities are handled differently. An object may be a directed or undirected
 * graph made up of one or more disjoint wires, each of which is a collection of connected
 * edges. In this case, each edge has exactly one coedge. The coedges are linked in circular
 * lists around each vertex using next and previous pointers according to which end of the
 * coedge lies at the vertex. The next or previous pointer of a coedge on an open edge may be set
 * to itself, indicating that there is no next or previous coedge on this branch of the wire.
 * <br><br>
 * - A shell may be of mixed dimensionality, containing both faces and unembedded edges.
 * The unembedded edges are connected together in wires and belong to the shell. Where they meet
 * faces of the shell, the vertices have multiple edge pointers, one for each face group, and one
 * for each wire attached.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>sg_get_coedges_of_wire</tt> and <tt>sg_q_coedges_around_vertex</tt> functions
 * may be useful for generating lists of coedges on other topological entities. The
 * <tt>geometry.hxx</tt> file contains several other geometric inquiry functions.
