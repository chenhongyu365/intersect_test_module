// Header for the TVERTEX class.
// The tvertex class is a derived class of vertex with a tolerance value.
// A tvertex is a 0-dimensional, topological entity that is used
// to bound an edge or a tedge. Each tvertex is represented by a point
// in the geometric model. The tolerance value indicates the maximum
// distance from the SPAposition of the tvertex to the end of each coedge.
// Two tvertices are coincident if the distance between their points is
// less than the maximum of their tolerance values. If the tolerance value
// is less than SPAresabs, then SPAresabs is used for coincidence checking.
// A tvertex and a vertex are coincident if the distance between their points is
// less than the maximum of the tvertex tolerance value and SPAresabs.
