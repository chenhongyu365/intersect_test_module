// Header for the EDGE class.

// The edge class represents the physical edge as recognised by the
// user.  It consists of a bounded portion of a space curve, the bounds
// being given as object-space vertices. (Any parametric bounds required
// for a parametric curve may be recorded within the edge.  These bounds are
// calculated from the vertex information and may be NULL if they
// have not been regenerated since the edge was last modified or
// retrieved.)

// The vertex pointer at either or both ends may be NULL,
// in which case the edge is taken to be unbounded in that direction.
// If the underlying curve is infinite, then so is the unbounded edge;
// if the curve is closed, then the vertex pointers must both be present
// or both NULL, and in the latter case the edge is the whole curve.

// As a special case, the geometry pointer may be NULL, while both
// vertex pointers point to the same vertex.  This is taken to mean that
// the "edge" is an isolated point (for example, the apex of a cone).
// Isolated points often represent non-manifold vertices and therefore
// require special care when encountered.  Edges with NULL geometry
// pointers should not be connected to edges with geometry; however,
// some algorithms (for example, Boolean operations) may use them
// during the course of the algorithm.
