 * implementations use an array of type FAST_FLOAT, instead.)
 * The DCT inputs are expected to be signed (range +-CENTERJSAMPLE).
 * The DCT outputs are returned scaled up by a factor of 8; they therefore
 * have a range of +-8K for 8-bit data, +-128K for 12-bit data.  This
 * convention improves accuracy in integer implementations and saves some
 * work in floating-point ones.
 * Quantization of the output coefficients is done by jcdctmgr.c.
