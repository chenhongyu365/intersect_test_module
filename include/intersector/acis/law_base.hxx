/**
 * Serves as the base class for all derived law classes.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The <tt>law</tt> class is the base class from which all other law classes
 * are derived. Laws are functions from <i>n</i> dimensional Euclidean space to
 * <i>m</i> dimensional Euclidean space. The <tt>law</tt> class provides virtual methods used
 * by all derived law class types.
 * <br><br>
 * A law is represented internally by a tree of C++ classes that know their
 * dimensions, how to evaluate themselves, and how to take their exact
 * (symbolic) derivatives with respect to any combination of variables.
 * Laws provide the ability to solve complex, global mathematical problems.
 * <br><br>
 * Laws are parsed in the same way that equations are presented in mathematics
 * textbooks. For example, the equation <tt>f(x,y) = x&sup2+cos(x)-sin(y)</tt> becomes the
 * law function <tt>"X^2+COS(X)-SIN(Y)"</tt>, with a two-dimensional domain and a
 * one-dimensional range.
 * <br><br>
 * For efficient memory management, the law classes are use-counted.  That is,
 * a data member called <tt>use_count</tt> is maintained in order to keep track
 * of how many pointers to a particular law object are in current use.  This
 * integer is incremented and decremented by means of the <tt>add</tt> and
 * <tt>remove</tt> methods.  Accordingly, when an application is finished
 * with a law, the <tt>remove</tt> method should be called instead of
 * the class destructor (or <tt>delete</tt>). The <tt>remove</tt> method
 * itself takes care of deleting the law when <tt>use_count</tt> falls to zero.
 * <br><br>
 * For example, consider the law <i>f</i> representing <tt>"X^2"</tt>, which is actually
 * an <tt>exponent_law</tt> whose arguments are an <tt>identity_law</tt> for <i>x</i> and a <tt>constant_law</tt>
 * for <tt>2</tt>. The new <i>df</i> law <tt>("2*X")</tt> created using the <tt>derivative</tt> method
 * of <i>f</i> is a <tt>times_law</tt> whose arguments are a <tt>constant_law</tt> for <tt>2</tt> and an
 * <tt>identity_law</tt> for <i>x</i>. In constructing the <i>df</i> law,
 * instead of creating new instances of the <tt>constant_law</tt> representing <tt>2</tt> and the
 * <tt>identity_law</tt> representing <i>x</i>, the constructor calls
 * their <tt>add</tt> methods, which increments their respective use counts. In this manner,
 * memory is not taken up with duplicates of the <tt>constant_law</tt> for <tt>2</tt> or the
 * <tt>identity_law</tt> for <i>x</i>. If the <tt>remove</tt> method of either <i>f</i> or
 * <i>df</i> is called, the <tt>remove</tt> methods of their sublaws are also called.
 * The sublaws decrement their own <tt>use_count</tt> members, and only actually call
 * the <tt>law::~law</tt> destructor if <tt>use_count</tt> goes to zero.
 * <br><br>
 * For convenience, the <tt>law</tt> class has a number of evaluation methods. The naming
 * convention for these is <tt>evaluateX_Y</tt>, where <tt>X</tt> refers to the input argument type
 * and <tt>Y</tt> refers to the output.  They can be any of the following:
 * <br><br>
 * <table width= 100%>
 * <tr width = 100%><td width = 10%>R </td>  <td> double (real) </td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>M </td>  <td> double* (multiple)</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>D </td>  <td> derivative</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>V </td>  <td> SPAvector</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>P </td>  <td> SPAposition</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>PP</td>  <td> SPApar_pos</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>NV</td>  <td> SPAnvector</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>T </td>  <td> SPAtransf</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>MAT</td> <td> SPAmatrix</td> </tr>
 * <tr><td>C  </td> <td> complex</td> </tr>
 * </table>
 * <br>
 * The <tt>use_count</tt> private data member stores the number of copies of this law that
 * are in use. The private data member <tt>simplified_flag</tt> is set if this law cannot
 * be simplified any more.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>type_flag</tt> is any one of the following values;
 * <br><br>
 * <table width= 100%>
 * <tr width = 100%><td width = 10%>0</td> <td> unknown </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>1</td> <td> zero    </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>2</td> <td> constant</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>3</td> <td> linear  </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>4</td> <td> polynomial</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>            G infinity </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>6</td> <td>    G 5 </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>7</td> <td>    G 4 </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>8</td> <td>    G 3 </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>9</td> <td>    G 2 </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>     G 1           </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>     Continuous    </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>     Bounded       </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>     Rational      </td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <br>
 * If a law is more than one type, the lower number is used. The <tt>not_type_flag</tt>
 * tells what a law is known not to be.
 * <br><br>
 * An application that needs to derive a law that is not already a part of ACIS should
 * do so from one of the big six law classes, which establish rules for parsing:
 * <tt>constant_law</tt>, <tt>unary_law</tt>, <tt>binary_law</tt>, <tt>multiple_law</tt>, <tt>unary_data_law</tt>, or
 * <tt>multiple_data_law</tt>.  All derived laws must have the following methods or inherit them:
 * <br><br>
 * <table width="70%">
 * <tr> <td>virtual law*   </td>  <td>derivative(int which=0) const;</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>virtual void   </td>  <td>evaluate(const double* x, double* answer) const;</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>virtual logical</td>  <td>isa(int t) const;</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>static  int    </td>  <td>id();</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>virtual int    </td>  <td>type() const;</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>virtual int    </td>  <td>return_dim() const;</td> </tr>
 * <tr> <td>virtual int    </td>  <td>take_dim() const;</td> </tr>
 * </table>
