* <b>Role:</b> This API function takes a body and as per the defeature_options object passed in, 
* recognizes and/or removes features.
* <br><br>
* The behavior of this API function is controlled using the defeature_options object. The defeature_options object 
* controls the actions of the API function. If a call is made
* with <tt>pause_after_recognize</tt> as <tt>TRUE</tt>, feature recognition is done but feature removal is not done. 
* The defeature_options object controls the type of features removed as well as specify parameters about the features.
* The types of features that can be removed are:
* <ul>
* <li>Holes</li>
* <li>Blends</li>
* <li>Chamfers</li>
* </ul>
* The removal of these features can be controlled using the parameters in the defeature_options object.
* For example, if only blends are to be removed, then the <tt>do_holes</tt> and <tt>do_chamfers</tt> 
* parameters are set to <tt>FALSE</tt>. 
* Further, the blends that are removed can be controlled by setting the <tt>blend_max_radius</tt> parameter
* to the appropriate value. Similarly, the behavior of the hole and chamfer removal can be controlled
* by setting the appropriate parameters on the defeature_options object.
