//  08-Mar-06 al : Added HELIX version numbers.

// This file contains a list of the version numbers of Acis at which

// restored into new Acis programs.

// First declare the variables which contain the version numbers
// of the current save file being restored. There is a major and
// minor component, and a portmanteau number which combines the two,
// and is the value actually placed in the save file.
