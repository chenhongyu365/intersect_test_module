//    Although this internal function is intended strictly for ACIS
//    usage, a minimal amount of information about this function is provided for the
//    sole purpose of being able to understand and trace restoration from a SAT file.
//    This function should never be called directly, because it makes assumptions
//    about the availability of a SAT file, the location of the input pointer into the
//    SAT file, and the validity of SAT data it expects to read in. It also may start
//    a lengthy process of nested function or class method calls, which have many of
//    the same assumptions.
//
//    None                                  Nothing is saved or restored.
