// Header for the BODY class.

// This class models a wire, sheet, or solid body (which may be several
// disjoint bodies treated as a collection of lumps).

// Lumps represent solids, sheets, and wires.  In a manifold solid, every
// edge is adjacent to two faces.  A non-manifold solid may have edges
// that are adjacent to more than two faces (or it may have more than one
// set of faces at a vertex.)  Edges in a sheet may bound any number of
// faces.  Edges of a wire do not bound any faces.

// A pure wire body contains wires, edges, coedges and vertices, but
// no faces.  Wires can represent isolated points, open or closed profiles,
// and general wire-frame models that are unsurfaced, i.e., have no faces.
// In recent versions of ACIS, wires are attached as a component of a shell
// and are not directly attached to the body.

// A solid body is represented by the boundary of the region of space
// enclosed by and modelled as a single lump composed of one or more disjoint
// SHELLs, containing no wires.

// The geometry of body is given in a local coordinate system, related
// to the universal one by a transformation stored with the body.

// ATTENTION Tech Pubs:
// Users may also find the topological traversal functions located in
// kernel/kerndata/top/query.hxx useful for generating lists of faces, edges
// and vertices on other topological entities.  Other functions of note
// include: get_body_box() to retrieve or recalculate the bounding SPAbox of
// a body, point_in_body() to determine the containment of a point versus
// a body, and raytest_body() to determine the intersections of a ray
// with a body.
