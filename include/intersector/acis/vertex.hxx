// Header for the VERTEX class.

// A vertex is a 0-dimensional, topological entity that is used
// to bound an edge or a tedge.  Generally, an edge is bounded by
// two distinct vertices; however, if the edge is closed, both ends
// of the edge are bounded by the same vertex.  A vertex embodies
// the user's view of a corner of a face or the junction point of
// two edges. Each vertex is represented by a point in the geometric model.
// Two vertices can not exist at the same point.

// A vertex maintains pointers to one or more of the edges which it
// bounds.  Generally, a vertex will contain a pointer to one of the
// edges it bounds.  The other edges can be found by following the
// next, previous and partner pointers of the coedges of the edges.
// When a body is non-manifold at a vertex, i.e., more than one
// manifold group of faces meet at a vertex or a wire attaches to a face
// at a vertex, then the vertex must maintain a pointer to an edge
// in each group of faces and wires.  The other edges in a manifold
// group of faces or a wire can be found by following coedge pointers.
