 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> Given a list of faces, imprints (optionally) the silhouettes
 * defined by the shadow cast by the draft parameters.
 * The silhouette is defined by the tangential field between the face 
 * %surface, the draft direction, and the draft angle. The angle is measured
 * from the draft direction. The angle between the draft direction and face normal
 * at the silhouette point is the complement of the draft angle. 
 * The resulting edges are output in a list of entities which contain zero to many. 
 * The <tt>imprint_silhouettes</tt> flag, if set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, will return all 
 * the silhouette curves, embedded in independent edges and trimmed to the boundaries of the face.
 * <br><br>

 * picks the closest solution to a point of view computed with the up direction.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Topology Changes:</b>

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API function creates copies of each face in the list <tt>given_faces</tt>,
 * and returns them in a new body, added to the list <tt>unhooked_bodies</tt>. Every
 * input face must belong to the same body.
 * <br><br>
 * If the argument <tt>copy</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the original model is not modified.
 * If <tt>copy</tt> is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, then the input faces are removed from their owning body
 * and deleted.
 * Edges and vertices that are no longer needed to support faces also removed.
 * This behavior differs from that of @href api_uncover_face, which converts redundant
 * edges to wire edges.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Caveat:</b> In api_unhook_faces functionality when the input parameter 'copy' is TRUE, 
 * the API doesn't consider input body Transform on copied unhooked bodies. <br>
 * If user wants to transform copied unhooked bodies according to input body Transform, 
 * then they have to turn ON the option header "transf_unhooked_bodies". 
 * Option header 'transf_unhooked_bodies' is introduced in Release 2023 1.0.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> This API function works only on faces that belong to the same owning body.
 * <br><br>

/**
 * Embeds a coincident wire in the faces of another body.
 * <br><b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Embedding Wires in Faces](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/a/d/d/Additional_Boolean_Operations_b537.html#Embedding_Wires_in_Faces)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API function embeds the edges of the given wire body in the faces of another body.
 * Note the caller is promising that the wire edges lies in the faces of the other body
 * to within the specified tolerance. Thus, if a wire edge meets the interior of a face,
 * then the edge must be coincident with the surface of that face to within the specified tolerance.
 * Edges intended to split a face must intersect with the face edges to within the specified
 * tolerance.
 * <br><br>
 * If the wire edge is not coincident everywhere with the other body to within the specified
 * tolerance, the results are undefined. A tolerance of less than <tt>SPAresabs</tt> will be ignored
 * and treated as <tt>SPAresabs</tt>.
 * If a tolerance greater than <tt>SPAresabs</tt> is specified, tolerant geometry may be introduced.
 * <br><br> 
 * A wire body consisting of a degenerate coedge/edge with a single vertex may not be 
 * imprinted nor embedded onto a sheet body. 
 * <br><br>
 * If <tt>face_list</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, then it is assumed that each edge of the wire is coincident with
 * <i>every</i> face that it contacts. If the wire does come into contact with
 * faces that should not be involved in the embedding, then the caller must supply a list excluding
 * those faces.
 * Particular care should be taken when a wire is coincident up to the boundary of one face but
 * it is not coincident with the adjacent face.
 * <br><br>
 * This API function is designed to be faster than the more general @href api_imprint.
 * This is because it relies on the coincidence of the wire to perform
 * fewer intersections. It is, therefore, essential that this API function is used correctly and the input
 * is accurate.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Example:</b> This example embeds a "square" wire in (a face of) a block.
 * <pre>
 *  outcome result;
 *  BODY *wire;
 *  BODY *body;

 *  SPAposition p1(10, -30, 10);

 *  SPAposition points[5] = {p1,p2,p3,p4,p1};
 *  result = api_make_wire(NULL, 5, points, wire);
 * 
 *  SPAposition q1(-30, -30, -30);
 *  SPAposition q2(30, 30, 30);
 *  result = api_solid_block(q1, q2, body);
 * 
 *  result = api_embed_wire_in_faces(wire, body);
 * </pre>
 * <b>Errors:</b> <tt>wire</tt> or <tt>body</tt> is a NULL pointer or does not point to a @href BODY.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Effect:</b> Changes models. Note that we actually imprint the intersection graph
 * on both entities, so the given wire might, for example, acquire extra vertices where
 * it crosses face boundaries. If a tolerance is used, tolerant geometry may be introduced.

 * This is a partial Boolean API function to create a @href surf_surf_int intersection structure to be

 * <br><b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Partial Booleans](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/p/a/r/Partial_Booleans_8b31.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This routine is passed a tool face and blank face together with
 * an array of edges which represent the intersection of the two faces. A
 * @href surf_surf_int structure is built using the geometry of these edges as the
 * intersection of the two surfaces, thereby eliminating the need to intersect the
 * faces themselves. To record this, an @href ATTRIB_FACEINT attribute is
 * attached to the tool face and no intersection will be performed when these
 * faces are to be intersected.
 * <br><br>
 * The logical argument <tt>check_rels</tt> specifies whether or not to check
 * if the intersection edges really lie in the faces. This can be
 * relatively expensive so may be avoided by passing <tt>FALSE</tt>, in which
 * case the edge-face relationships are being guaranteed by the caller.
 * <br><br>
 * <i>Coordinate Systems and Transformations:</i> 
 * The intersection edges must be in the coordinate system of the blank body. 
 * For instance, if the blank body is in the world coordinate system 
 * (that is, the blank body does not have a transformation attached to it) 
 * then the intersection edges will also be specified in world coordinates. 
 * If the blank body does have a transformation attached to it, the intersection 
 * edges will be in the space of the untransformed blank body (that is, with respect 
 * to the world coordinate system the intersection edges will be transformed by 
 * the inverse of the transform on the blank body). 
 * The transformation associated with the tool face, <tt>ttrans</tt>, must be the 
 * transformation to convert from the coordinate system of the tool body into 
 * the coordinate system of the blank body. If T<sub>t</sub> is the transformation 
 * on the tool body and T<sub>b</sub> is the transformation on the blank body, 
 * then the transformation from tool coordinates to blank coordinates, is: 
 * T<sub>tb</sub> = T<sub>t</sub> * T<sub>b</sub><sup>-1</sup>. If both the tool 
 * and blank bodies are in the world coordinate system, then <tt>ttrans</tt> will be 
 * the identity transformation.
 * The transformation associated with the blank face, <tt>btrans</tt>, must be the 
 * identity transformation.

 * <li>Adjacent faces should intersect only in edges or vertices lying between the faces.</li>
 * <li>Faces that are not adjacent should not intersect.</li>
 * <li>Adjacent edges should intersect only at vertex lying between the edges.</li>
 * <li>Edges that are not adjacent should not intersect.</li>
 * <li>Two shells in the same lump should have a correct containment relation 
 * and they should not intersect.</li>
 * <li>No lump should be contained in another lump and they should not intersect.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Any faces in the entity that belong to entities in the list
 * <tt>insane_ents</tt> are removed from consideration. From the remaining
 * faces, each pair of distinct faces is intersected. Any
 * intersections not reflected in the topology of the model are deemed
 * improper.
 * <br><br>
 * By default, checks for improper edge-edge intersections are not
 * performed unless the owning face contains free edges (that is, coedges
 * without a partner). To force checks for improper edge-edge
 * intersections on all faces, the option <tt>check_ee_int_always</tt> should
 * be switched on.

 * This API function also checks valid shells and valid lumps for improper
 * containments. Containment tests are only performed when

 * no bad faces (that is, it does not contain and is not contained by any
 * entity in <tt>insane_ents</tt>) and does not contain intersecting
 * faces. Similarly, lumps are valid when they contain no bad faces,
 * intersection faces, or shells with improper containment. Two shells
 * in the same lump have bad containment if either does not contain
 * the other. Two lumps have bad containment when one contains the
 * other.
 * <br><br>

 * Stitches faces along edges and vertices of identical geometry.
 * <br><b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Stitching Faces](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/a/d/d/Additional_Boolean_Operations_b537.html#Stitching_Faces)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API function joins two face bodies along edges and vertices that are
 * identical. Stitching operates only on faces, not on wires, and only stitches
 * faces to faces. If wires exist in one of the bodies being stitched, but do not
 * participate in the stitch (that is, they do not coincide with edges in the other
 * body), they will transfer to the resulting body.
 * <br><br>
 * The result is returned in the first body <tt>b1</tt>. The second body,
 * <tt>b2</tt>, is deleted unless it is the same as <tt>b1</tt>.
 * For example, a body might need internal stitching. You can stitch
 * <tt>b1</tt> to <tt>b1</tt>, and the body is not deleted.
 * <br><br>
 * When creating two-manifold edges on single-sided faces, stitching merges
 * geometry on coedges that have opposite edge sense and identical edge geometry
 * (within tolerance). The API will fail if coedges of incompatible orientation
 * (that is, same edge sense) are encountered. If the faces are double-sided, the
 * coedges need not be of opposite sense.
 * <br><br>
 * If the argument <tt>split</tt> is <tt>FALSE</tt>, the edges must be identical along their entire
 * length. If <tt>split</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, this API function splits edges in order to match coincident
 * coedges. Coincident edges on single-sided faces and of incompatible orientation
 * (opposite coedge sense) are not split.
 * <br><br>
 * When creating non-manifold edges, the coedges are sorted and a "union" is
 * performed around the coedge, marking faces that are now <tt>BOTH_INSIDE</tt> as such. The
 * <tt>BOTH_INSIDE</tt> containment is then propagated to all faces not connected through a
 * stitched edge.
 * <br><br>
 * When vertices at the same location (within tolerance) are merged, they become
 * non-manifold and they contain all surrounding face groups. If the attempt to make
 * a two-manifold edge stitch fails, the vertices are not merged.
 * <br><br>
 * Unlike other Boolean Component API functions, this API function does <i>not</i> perform a Boolean operation.
 * Stitching is simpler than a Boolean operation because it avoids face-face intersections
 * and the evaluation of lump and shell containments.
 * <br><br>
 * For information on more comprehensive stitching functionality not located in the Boolean Component
 * refer to the Technical Article <i>Stitching</i>.
