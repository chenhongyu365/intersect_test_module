/**
 * Represents the position of a point as an object in the model.

 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>APOINT</tt> is a model geometry class that records the object space position of a
 * point. In general, a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a
 * permanent model object. It provides model management functionality, in addition to the
 * geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * The geometric definition of a point is stored as a <tt>SPAposition</tt> in the <tt>APOINT</tt> class. Cartesian
 * coordinates are assumed, though in principle other coordinate systems might be implemented.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>APOINT</tt> has member methods to provide access to
 * specific implementations of the geometry. For example, methods are available to set and
 * retrieve the coordinates of a point.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to an <tt>APOINT</tt>. The construction of a new <tt>APOINT</tt>
 * initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement the use count,
 * and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
 * <br><br>
 * This class is named <tt>APOINT</tt> to avoid compile and link conflicts with the Microsoft class <tt>POINT</tt>.
