// Header for INTCURVE.

// An INTCURVE, itself a derived class of CURVE, records an
// interpolated approximation to a general curve of intersection
// between two surfaces, as an intcurve (and a use-count within the
// parent CURVE record).  The intcurve record consists
// of a pointer to an int_cur and a logical denoting reversal of the
// int_cur.  The int-cur in turn contains a use-count, a 3d-spline
// termed a bs3_curve, a real for a fit tolerance, two pointers to
// the (lower-case) surfaces meeting in the intersection curve, and
// zero, one or two 2d-splines, termed bs2_splines, that record
// interpolated curves in SPAparameter space, depending on whether
// zero, one or both surfaces are parametric surfaces.

 * general curve.
 * <br><br>
