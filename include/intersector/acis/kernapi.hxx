 * <br><br>

 * current or active <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> of the given <tt>HISTORY_STREAM</tt>.
 * If neither a <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> nor a <tt>HISTORY_STREAM</tt> are supplied,
 * this function uses either the current or active <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> of the 
 * default <tt>HISTORY_STREAM</tt>. If a <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> is supplied,

 * (on and) between the given <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> and the current state of the model. 
 * This function supports rolled <tt>DELTA_STATEs</tt> and branched <tt>HISTORY_STREAMs</tt>. 
 * In addition, it can examine the most recent <tt>BULLETIN_BOARD</tt> when
 * application logging is turned off (set with @href api_logging). If application
 * logging is turned off and an application needs to examine the faces changed by
 * multiple API functions, all of the API functions must be contained within a single
 * <tt>API_BEGIN/API_END</tt> block. In addition, the application must use the
 * "bounding box based algorithm" described below.
 * <br><br>
 * This API function will use one of two algorithms. One algorithm, the "bounding box 
 * based algorithm," depends upon bounding boxes on faces being reset whenever
 * a significant change is made to the shape of a face. This algorithm requires
 * the bounding boxes of faces to be calculated as part of any operation that
 * modifies the model. This may occur as a result of faceting the model at the end
 * of an operation, or may occur independent of faceting. The other algorithm,
 * which is invoked when a <tt>DELTA_STATE</tt> is supplied and the <tt>use_lower_topology</tt>
 * flag is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, examines the <tt>BULLETINs</tt> of faces and
 * all constituent entities. This algorithm does not depend on bounding boxes being
 * set before each operation and reset by the operation to find modified faces.
 * The "bounding box based algorithm" is the more efficient of the two algorithms;
 * however, it does require the application to recalculate bounding boxes as a part 
 * of each operation. 
 * <br><br>
 * This API function does not clear the deleted, created, and modified lists before
 * writing to them (that is, it appends to the given lists).

 * it was created using <tt>api_save_entity_list</tt>) then the <tt>create_new_hs</tt>
 * flag is examined. If the flag is <tt>TRUE</tt>, a new history stream is
 * instantiated to hold the created entities. If the flag is <tt>FALSE</tt>, the
 * entities in the file are created in the default stream. All created
 * <tt>HITORY_STREAM</tt>s are added to the <tt>HISTORY_STREAM_LIST</tt> <tt>hlist</tt>; no change
 * in the <tt>HISTORY_STREAM_LIST</tt> indicates the file had no history and the
 * entities were placed in the default stream. <tt>api_get_active_entities</tt>
 * can be called on the streams in <tt>hlist</tt> to find the entities read in.
 * <br><br>
 * The file pointer is an open file positioned at the point where the reading 
 * should begin. When the restore is complete, the file pointer
 * will be correctly positioned at the end of the restored data. This allows
 * an application to restore multiple entities intermixed with other
 * application-specific data in a single save file.
 * <br><br>
 * Establish in the calling routine whether the file is text or binary
 * type. Set <tt>text_mode</tt> correctly: <tt>TRUE</tt> if the file is text, <tt>FALSE</tt> if
 * binary. Restoring a binary file is about twice as fast as restoring a text file.
 * <br><br>
 * When an <tt>ENTITY</tt> is restored from a file, any unrecognized main <tt>ENTITY</tt>
 * types (<tt>BODY</tt>, <tt>CURVE</tt>, etc.) are skipped and any references to those
 * entities are set to <tt>NULL</tt>.
 * Unrecognized descendent entities of <tt>ATTRIB</tt>, <tt>SURFACE</tt>, or <tt>CURVE</tt>
 * generate a new record for their immediate owner class, and references
 * to them become references to the new record. If a record for a derived
 * class of <tt>ATTRIB</tt> is not recognized, an <tt>ATTRIB</tt> record results so that
 * the chain of attributes for the entity owning the unrecognized
 * attribute remains connected.
 * <br><br>
 * It is possible to restore entities made by versions having different
 * sets of attribute classes. Attribute types common to the two versions
 * are restored, but attributes of types unknown to the receiving version
 * are ignored.
 * <br><br>
 * A warning is given if the version of the product receiving the model
 * differs from the version that made the save file. It is an error if

 * to the current state (the main line) are saved. This is equivalent
 * to ignoring all rolled delta states. If <tt>active_ents_only</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, then

 * <br><br>
 * In addition to managing roll information, history streams also manage
 * entity id information; an entity id is unique to a history stream.
 * Entity IDs can only only be persisted by saving with history (using
 * @href api_save_history or @href api_save_entity_list_with_history).
 * Entity IDs are ignored when reading in with <tt>api_restore_entity_list</tt>;
 * they are only restored when using @href api_restore_entity_list_with_history
 * or @href api_restore_history. The main difference between using
 * @href api_save_entity_list and @href api_save_history
 * with <tt>active_ents_only</tt> = <tt>TRUE</tt> is that @href api_save_history maintains
 * the tag information.
 * <br><br>
 * The file pointer argument should be an open file positioned at the

 * Changes the transform entity attached to a body.
 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Transformation](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/t/r/a/Transformation.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> When transformations are applied to a body in ACIS, the
 * underlying geometries of all the subordinate entities are not changed.
 * This API simply attaches the transformation to the <tt>BODY</tt> entity and
 * indicates that calculations should pipe the geometry through the
 * transform. Each <tt>BODY</tt>'s transformation matrix gives the relationship
 * between its internal coordinate system and the working coordinate system.
 * <br><br>
 * If you want the transform actually applied to the geometry (called "fixing" the transform), use the
 * @href api_change_body_trans function. After applying the
 * transformation,
 * <pre>
 * BODY* my_body;
 * api_apply_transf(my_body, transf);</pre>
 * change the geometry of the object according to this transformation
 * by changing the <tt>BODY</tt>'s transform to an empty transformation:
 * <pre>
 * api_change_body_trans(my_body, NULL);</pre>
 * (This does increase the risk of introducing round-off errors to the geometry.)
 * <br><br>
 * Use transformations with caution. Scaling and translation effects can
 * combine to produce increasingly severe gaps in the geometry. Scaling
 * transforms not only scale up or down the geometry, but also scale up
 * or down gaps in the geometry. Furthermore, if you translate the geometry sufficiently, you can
 * move it far enough away from the origin that a gap is represented with
 * zero bits of resolution, and you cannot resolve it. Because <tt>SPAresabs</tt> does
 * not change, at some point geometric operations will fail.
 * <br><br>
 * Beyond these concerns, you should be aware that the application of a non-uniform scaling with
 * this API
 * <i>necessitates</i> that you fix the transform, in the manner shown above.  Such operations are handled by
 * Space Warping, which can create new topology by placing seam edges on periodic
 * %spline surfaces, for example, so that fixing the transform should be done immediately after the
 * transform is applied.
 * <br><br>

 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Transformation](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/t/r/a/Transformation.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API changes the geometry to leave the body unaltered in its
 * global coordinate space. Each <tt>BODY</tt> contains a transformation matrix that gives
 * the relationship between the internal coordinate system and that of the world
 * coordinate system. This API transforms the geometric definitions within the
 * object so that with the new transformation set in the body transformation, the
 * shape and position of the object are unchanged.
 * <br><br>
 * If <tt>negate</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, this API negates the <tt>BODY</tt> by reflecting it about the origin
 * and reversing all directions.
 * <br><br>
 * Calling this API with a <tt>NULL</tt> transform pointer leaves the body with a <tt>NULL</tt>
 * transform, and any existing transforms are applied to the body geometry. For
 * example, to scale the <tt>BODY</tt>'s geometry, first call this API with the scaling
 * transform and then call it again with a <tt>NULL</tt> transform.

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This comprehensive API behaves analogous to the collection of
 * like API's that return the related entities of a specific entity, such as
 * @href api_get_faces and @href api_get_edges. This API however allows the specification of
 * multiple entity types to be returned from a single pass of the traversal
 * algorithm. The entity selection is made by passing a bit mask of topological IDs,
 * and optionally geometrical IDs, to the API. The bit masks are created by
 * "or-ing" the respective IDs together, as the following example demonstrates:
 * <pre>
 *    ENTITY_ID topo_bits = FACE_ID | EDGE_ID;
 *    ENTITY_ID geom._bits = SURFACE_ID | CURVE_ID; </pre>
 * The <tt>ENTITY_ID</tt> bit masks are categorized into topology IDs and geometry IDs, and
 * cannot be mixed. They are however, mutually exclusive within their respective
 * groups.
 * <br><br>
 * The following topological IDs are available:
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>BODY_ID</tt>, <tt>LUMP_ID</tt>, <tt>SHELL_ID</tt>, <tt>SUBSHELL_ID</tt>, <tt>WIRE_ID</tt>, <tt>FACE_ID</tt>, <tt>LOOP_ID</tt>, <tt>COEDGE_ID</tt>,
 * <tt>EDGE_ID</tt>, <tt>VERTEX_ID</tt>
 * <br><br>
 * The following geometrical IDs are available:
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>TRANSFORM_ID</tt>, <tt>APOINT_ID</tt>, <tt>PCURVE_ID</tt>, <tt>SURFACE_ID</tt>, <tt>CURVE_ID</tt>
 * <br><br>
 * Given a set of topological ID selections, the traversal algorithm searches for
 * the selected entities from the level of the input entity within the topological
 * hierarchy, and works its way down, selecting all that are lower in the
 * hierarchical order. When the selection set contains entity IDs that are higher
 * in the topological hierarchy than the input entity, then the higher-level
 * entities that share the input entities are also selected.
 * <br><br>
 * Given a <tt>FACE</tt> input entity with <tt>LUMP_ID</tt> and <tt>LOOP_ID</tt> selection IDs, for example,
 * the algorithm would select the owning <tt>LUMP</tt>, ignoring others, and would halt the
 * traversal after selecting all loops of the face since the <tt>LOOP_ID</tt> is the lowest
 * selection ID.
 * <br><br>
 * The algorithm does not traverse laterally and will simply select the input
 * entity in this case. For example, given a <tt>FACE</tt> input entity and a <tt>FACE_ID</tt>
 * selection, the input face would be returned.
 * <br><br>
 * The geometrical ID selections drive the algorithm in the same manner and assume
 * the same level in the hierarchy as their topological owners.
 * <br><br>

 * Creates a law from a string and an optional array of law data.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API parses a character string (<tt>str</tt>), generates the
 * associated law classes, and returns a pointer to the top-level law that was
 * created (<tt>answer</tt>). Deriving the <tt>law</tt> class and all associated classes individually
 * is possible. However, it is more likely that <tt>api_str_to_law</tt> and law string
 * parsing will be employed, because it is easier and more straightforward to
 * implement.
 * <br><br>
 * The valid syntax for the character strings (<tt>str</tt>) in the law mathematical
 * functions are given in the law symbol templates. The law mathematical functions
 * support nesting of law symbols. Once the character string (<tt>str</tt>) has been created,
 * it is passed to <tt>api_str_to_law</tt> along with a pointer to an output law (<tt>answer</tt>),
 * an array of law data (<tt>data</tt>), and the size of the law data array (<tt>size</tt>).
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>unary_law</tt>, <tt>binary_law</tt>, and <tt>multiple_law</tt> classes are used if the application
 * is passing only laws into a law class, in which case it becomes a pointer to a
 * law or an array of pointers to laws, respectively. Numbers, positions,
 * parametric positions, vectors, and vector fields, in addition to the law symbols,
 * are passed as input to the <tt>api_str_to_law</tt> and become laws for these purposes.
 * <br><br>
 * On the other hand, the <tt>unary_data_law</tt> and <tt>multiple_data_law</tt> classes are used if
 * the application is passing more complicated structures into a law class. These
 * could be curves, wires, surfaces, transforms, or even laws. Instead of having a
 * pointer to a law or an array of pointers to laws, the <tt>unary_data_law</tt> and
 * <tt>multiple_data_law</tt> classes have a pointer to a <tt>law_data</tt> class or an array of

/**
 * Creates the default rail laws for sweeping along a wire.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This produces an array of rail laws that can be used by sweeping
 * in the sweep options. A single rail law is produced if <tt>path</tt> is a single edge
 * or a wire with a single underlying edge. Otherwise, it creates multiple rail
 * laws, one for each underlying edge in <tt>path</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * The only required argument is <tt>path</tt>. If no other arguments are supplied, then
 * default rails are created. The default for the creation of rails is:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the path is planar, the rail law is the planar normal. A constant
 * vector law is returned.</li>
 * <li>If the path is a helix, the rail law points towards the axis. The Frenet
 * law is returned.</li>
 * <li>If all edges in the wire are planar, then an array of rail laws is
 * created, whereby each law in the array corresponds to an edge in the wire. The
 * rail laws correspond to the planar normal of edges.</li>
 * <li>If faces are provided, then surface normal laws are returned. In this case, the path should be a wire, with edges on the supplied faces.</li>
 * <li>If the path isn't one of the above cases, the rail uses minimum rotation.</li>
 * </ul><br>
 * If the input <tt>path</tt> is composed of multiple pieces, such as a wire with more than
 * one underlying edge, then array arguments must supply the same number of
 * elements as the number of <tt>path</tt> elements. They may pad their array with <tt>NULL</tt>
 * arguments.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>axis</tt> argument is used for path segments that have an implied center axis. An
 * example of this might be a helix, an expanding helix, or the coil of a telephone
 * handset cable. The <tt>axis</tt> argument is the derivative of the implied center axis,
 * which tells the implied axis direction. When the <tt>axis</tt> is supplied, then its
 * cross product with the path is returned. The <tt>axis</tt> array can be padded with <tt>NULL</tt>
 * for sections of the <tt>path</tt> that do not have an implied axis.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>face</tt> argument is used when a portion of the path segments borders a
 * non-analytic face. The coedge of the wire provided as <tt>path</tt> must actually belong
 * to the face entity supplied. The face must be non-analytic. The resulting rail
 * is oriented to the face normal. The <tt>face</tt> array can be padded with <tt>NULL</tt> for
 * sections of the path that do not have such a face.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>user_rails</tt> argument permits any default rail for a given section of the path
 * to be overridden by the user-supplied law in the array. The <tt>user_rails</tt> array can
 * be padded with <tt>NULL</tt> for sections of the path that are to use the default.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>twist</tt> argument works on the whole rail array. After the other rail
 * parameters have been input and calculated, the law provided by <tt>twist</tt> operates on
 * the whole set of rails. This takes in an angle of twist per distance along the
 * path.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> When faces are supplied, the path must be a wire, with each edge lying in the corresponding face.

/**
 * Splits the approximating surface for a <tt>VBL_SURF</tt> into <tt>n</tt> four-sided <tt>bs3_surface</tt> patches.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API approximates an <i>n</i>-sided @href VBL_SURF by n four-sided
 * <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt>, which enables ACIS to output vertex blend surfaces in a form that
 * can be read and used by most other packages.
 * <br><br>
 * In ACIS, the <tt>VBL_SURF</tt> is approximated by a <tt>bs3_surface</tt> whose parameterization is
 * defined over an <i>n</i>-sided regular polygon. This API makes up <i>n</i> four-sided patches
 * that are separated from one another in the original approximating surface
 * parameter space by straight lines radiating from the center of the <i>n</i>-sided
 * polygon to the midpoint of each of the sides. The new approximating surfaces are
 * parameterized over the unit square. Adjacent <tt>bs3_surface</tt> patches are made up to
 * have the same number of knot points along common boundaries, and so the surfaces
 * are C0 continuous across the boundaries. However, the parameter lines do not run
 * smoothly across the boundaries, and so the approximation is not C1 or G1
 * continuous across the patch boundaries.
 * <br><br>
 * The API function receives a pointer to a surface, which has an underlying
 * <tt>VBL_SURF</tt>. The caller should also supply two doubles, which specify the requested
 * fit tolerances of the approximating surfaces, both on the interior of the
 * <tt>VBL_SURF</tt>, and on its boundary. These will return the fit tolerances that the
 * approximating surfaces have achieved, which may be larger than the requested fit
 * tolerances, if these are particularly small, or if the surface is particularly
 * complex. One might, for example, request an internal fit tolerance of .001 and a
 * boundary fit tolerance that is 10 times smaller than this. Note that the
 * interior fit tolerance (but NOT the boundary one) may be passed as exactly -1.0
 * to mean "do not measure the interior fit", in which case no particular interior
 * fit is guaranteed, except that which comes about naturally by having fit the
 * boundary correctly, and no meaningful value is returned for the achieved
 * interior fit. The function can operate more quickly if no specific interior fit
 * is requested. The internal joins between the patch boundaries are unaffected by
 * this.
 * <br><br>
 * The caller must also supply the function with a pointer to a <tt>bs3_surface</tt> and a
 * reference to an integer. These will be used to return an array of the
 * approximating <tt>bs3_surface</tt>s and the length of this array, respectively.
 * Additionally, an <tt>approx_error</tt> flag can be supplied which specifies whether the
 * errors returned need to be precise or merely a (close) upper bound. If passed
 * <tt>TRUE</tt>, the error is bounded approximately but quite closely, and the function
 * will be able to work more quickly.
 * <br><br>
 * If the supplied surface is of type spline and the underlying <tt>spl_sur</tt> is a
 * <tt>VBL_SURF</tt>, this API function makes up <i>n</i> four-sided approximating <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt>. A
 * pointer to an array of these <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt> is then returned, along with the
 * number of <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt> in the array, and the maximum internal and boundary fit
 * tolerances of the <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt>. If the supplied surface is not a spline, or if
 * it is a <tt>spline</tt> and the underlying <tt>spl_sur</tt> is not a VBL_SURF, this API function
 * returns a <tt>NULL</tt> <tt>bs3_surface</tt> pointer and sets the number of approximating
 * <tt>bs3_surfaces</tt> to zero.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Errors:</b> A <tt>NULL</tt> pointer to a surface is specified. The <tt>spl_sur</tt> underlying the

 * <b>Role:</b> Applies the default minimization actions, or the specific actions of the optional 
 * @href minimize_options object, on the geometry of the input entities.
 * This API allows you to page geometric data to disk and to delete lazy approximations, 
 * which can drastically reduce the working memory footprint of the model. 
 * The paged geometric data is automatically unpaged and the lazy data is automatically recalculated when needed.
 * The input entities are scanned downward, which allows you to be very specific as to which geometry is to be affected.
 * When the input entity is a face, for example, then only the geometry of that face's edges and coedges are minimized.
 * In contrast, given a body input entity, all the geometry is to be minimized.
 * The location and name of the page file can be set with the @href initialize_page_system function.
 * The effectiveness of the paging system can be evaluated with the @href get_page_statistics function.
