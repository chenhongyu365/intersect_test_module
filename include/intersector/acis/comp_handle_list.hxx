// This class implements a variable-length list for component_handle objects.  The list
// is meant to look and feel much like the ENTITY_LIST class.  But in addition
// to the standard list functionality, this class can also act as a "holding"
// object and/or as a counted list.
//
// When "holding" is turned on, the list "holds" the objects in the sense that
// entries' use counts are adjusted as they are added to and deleted from the
// list.  The use counting mechanism ensures that cleanup operations do not
// destroy the objects being held.
//
// In counted list mode, the entry count keeps track of the number of times an
// entry has been added minus the number of times the same entry has been
// removed.  The entry count must be zero in order for the entry to actually
// be taken off list, i.e. the number of adds must equal the number of deletes.
// When the counted list mode is turned off, the first call to remove an entry
// from the list always causes that entry to be taken off the list immediately.
//
// The component_handle_list class is a wrapper for the component_handle_list_eng class, 
// which implements the core functionality.

/**
 * Implements a variable length list of component handles with set and index behavior and optional holding and counting mechanisms.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This class is a list object for <tt>component_handle</tt> objects that is intended to have the look and feel
 * of the ENTITY_LIST class.  But the functionality has been extended to include holding and counting mechanisms.
 * <br><br>
 * If the counting mechanism is turned on, then the list keeps track of the entry count, i.e. the number of times the same entry
 * has been added minus the number of times it has been removed.  The entry is deleted from the list
 * only if the entry count reaches zero.
 * <br>
 * When the holding state of the list is set to <tt>ASM_HOLD</tt>, the list increments the use count of each entry.
 * This ensures that "held" entries are not deleted when the handles are cleaned up.  For details on cleaning up handles,
 * please refer to the documentation on the <tt>asm_model</tt> object.
 * <br>
 * The holding and counting mechanisms are specified when the <tt>component_handle_list</tt> object is constructed.
 * Additionally, the holding state can be changed using <tt>component_handle_list::set_hold_state</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * Handles are added to the end of the list using <tt>component_handle_list::add</tt> which ensures that the handles are not
 * already in the list (i.e. set behavior).  The <tt>component_handle_list::remove</tt> methods take entries off the list, 
 * but a tombstone remains at the position of the former entries.  The <tt>component_handle_list::add_notify</tt> and 
 * <tt>component_handle_list::remove_notify</tt> methods notify the caller when the list is actually modified.
 * <br>
 * The position of current entries can be determined using <tt>component_handle_list::lookup</tt>, and the entry at a specified position
 * may be accessed using the overloaded <tt>"[ ]"</tt> index operator.  The number of entries in the list is returned by
 * <tt>component_handle_list::count</tt> (includes tombstones) and <tt>component_handle_list::iteration_count</tt> (excludes tombstones).
 * The preferred way of accessing the data items is through <tt>component_handle_list::init</tt> which rewinds the list
 * and <tt>component_handle_list::next</tt> which returns the next undeleted item.  The <tt>component_handle_list::first</tt> method
 * rewinds the list and returns the first non-deleted entry.
 * <br><br>
 * The current implementation uses hashing so that <tt>component_handle_list::lookup</tt> is fast;
 * it is also efficient for very short lists and for repeated lookups of the same component handle.
 * <br><br>
 * When a group of component handles must be returned, and the number of arguments is not known in
 * advance, the system returns the arguments as an <tt>component_handle_list</tt>. For instance, when the routine
 * <tt>asm_get_sub_components</tt> is used to find the child components of a component, the handles found
 * are put into an <tt>component_handle_list</tt> that is returned.
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 * component_handle_list my_handles;
 * asm_get_sub_components( comp_handle, my_handles );
 * for ( component_handle* handle = my_handles.first(); handle != NULL; handle = my_handles.next() )
 * {
 * .
 * .
 * .
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * <b>Note: </b>The general method for retrieving the number of entries in an <tt>component_handle_list</tt> is iteration_count().
 * This function prevents having the list iterators skip deleted entries. Else some routines encounter arrays
 * with uninitialized entries and unexpected results may occur.
 * <br>
 * If the count method is used to determine the number of entries in an <tt>component_handle_list</tt> (including tombstones),
 * then individual entries can be accessed with the index <tt>operator [ ]</tt>.
 * <br>
 * <b>Note: </b> The index <tt>operator [ ]</tt> does not ignore "removed" entries).
 * <br> <br>
 * Be sure to check the returned pointer
 * for the constant LIST_ENTRY_DELETED (-1), which indicates a tombstone (removed entry) at that index.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>component_handle_list</tt> class is a variable length associative array of <tt>component_handle</tt> pointers. When using
 * the subscript operator, a cast is required to change the <tt>component_handle</tt> pointer into the correct type.
 * Many ACIS internal algorithms use <tt>component_handle_list</tt> including the save, and restore algorithms.
 * <tt>component_handle_list</tt> is also useful in <tt>ACIS</tt> components and applications.
