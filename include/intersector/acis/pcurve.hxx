/**
 * Defines a 2D parameter-space approximation to a curve as an object in the model.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The purpose of a <tt>PCURVE</tt> is to provide a persistent, logable, savable object to
 * manage pcurve information associated with a <tt>COEDGE</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>PCURVE</tt> is a model geometry class that provides a (lowercase) pcurve, the corresponding
 * construction geometry class. In general, a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is
 * used to define a permanent model object. It provides model management functionality, in
 * addition to the geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * A <tt>PCURVE</tt> provides a procedural 2D parameter-space representation of a <tt>CURVE</tt> lying on a
 * parameterized <tt>SURFACE</tt>. The representation may be a private copy (i.e., contained within a
 * lowercase pcurve associated with the <tt>PCURVE</tt>), or it may refer to information contained within
 * an intcurve. In either case, it may be negated from the underlying parameter space
 * representation. Because there is only one such representation, this class does not need to
 * have derived classes for specific geometries.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>PCURVE</tt> has member methods to provide access to
 * specific implementations of the geometry. For example, a pcurve can be transformed by a given
 * transform operator.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>PCURVE</tt>. The construction of a new <tt>PCURVE</tt>
 * initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement the use count,
 * and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
