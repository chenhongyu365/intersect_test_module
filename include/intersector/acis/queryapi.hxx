* <br><br>
* <b>Role:</b> This API finds the mass properties requested by the user.  These
* may include the volume, center of gravity (centroid), inertia tensor, principal
* moments, and principal axes of the given body. Options controlling the calculation 
* are specified by means of an (optional) <tt>mass_props_options</tt> object; the results 
* are returned in the form of a <tt>mass_props</tt> object.  Please refer to the 
* documentation of these two classes for details on setting options and retrieving the 
* calculated results, respectively.
* <br><br>
* When the <tt>mass_props_options</tt> argument is omitted, the following default 
* behavior is followed:
* <br><br>
* 1) projection-plane information is selected by the API;
* <br>
* 2) volume, centroid, and inertia are all calculated;
* <br>
* 3) the requested relative accuracy is one-percent;
* <br>
* 4) sheets are treated as having zero thickness; and,
* <br>
* 5) errors are thrown when voids or open, one-sided sheets are encountered.
* <br><br>
* The user should provide a <tt>mass_props_options</tt> object configured otherwise
* if some alternate behavior is preferred.
* <br><br>
* Although computation of mass properties does not make substantive changes to a
* model, bounding boxes may be calculated and cached in the model, creating a bulletin board.

/**
 * Determines whether two bodies clash, and optionally how they clash if so.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API tests for a clash between two input bodies. The bodies
 * clash if there is a point on one body which is within SPAresabs of the other
 * body. This can be applied to closed solid bodies or sheet bodies. It 
 * can also produce information about the way in which the bodies clash, and
 * generate a full list of all of the pairs of boundary entities on the bodies
 * that clash.
 * <br><br>
 * The results of the clash test are returned in an object of type @href body_clash_result
 * passed into the API.
 * <br><br>
 * The API has three different modes of operation to allow users to trade off
 * level of detail against performance:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>CLASH_EXISTENCE_ONLY</tt>:<br>
 *      The API will do as little work as necessary to ascertain whether or not
 *      the bodies clash, with no analysis of the way that they clash. The
 *      result type will always be <tt>CLASH_NONE</tt> (bodies do not clash) or
 *      <tt>CLASH_UNCLASSIFIED</tt> (bodies do clash), and no boundary entity pairs or
 *      containing body will be returned.
 * </li>
 * <br><br>
 * <li><tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_BODIES</tt>:<br>
 *      The API will do as little work as necessary to determine the way in
 *      which the bodies clash. The result type will be one of <tt>CLASH_NONE</tt>,
 *      <tt>CLASH_COINCIDENT</tt>, <tt>CLASH_CONTAINED</tt>, <tt>CLASH_CONTAINED_ABUTS</tt>, 
 *      <tt>CLASH_ABUTS</tt>,
 *      or <tt>CLASH_INTERLOCK</tt>. If one body is contained within the other, the
 *      containing_body() member will be set to the body that contains the other.
 *      No sub-entity pairs will be returned.
 * </li>
 * <br><br>
 * <li><tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_SUB_ENTITIES</tt>:<br>
 *      The API will classify every pair of faces and wire edges in the bodies
 *      that clash, and return not only the classification for the bodies, but
 *      also a list of all sub-entity pairs that clash with their individual
 *      classifications. For each sub-entity pair returned, the "a" entry in
 *      each pair will be owned by <tt>body_a</tt> and the "b" entry will be 
 *      owned by <tt>body_b</tt>.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Relative speed of modes:</b>
 * In the worst case (no clash), there should be no measurable difference in time
 * taken to compute the clashes using different modes. Hence, the <em>guaranteed</em>
 * performance in any particular case is only that <tt>CLASH_EXISTENCE_ONLY</tt> calculation
 * will be no slower than either other mode, and <tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_BODIES</tt> will be no
 * slower than <tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_SUB_ENTITIES</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * On average, however, it can be expected that the <tt>CLASH_EXISTENCE_ONLY</tt> operation will
 * be faster than <tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_BODIES</tt>, which will in turn be faster than
 * <tt>CLASH_CLASSIFY_SUB_ENTITIES</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b>
 * Open solid bodies are not supported. It is not possible to determine definitively
 * whether such bodies clash in an efficient manner. For performance reasons,
 * this API <em>does not</em> reject open solid bodies, and in many cases will produce
 * correct results, but the results returned are not guaranteed to be accurate,
 * or for different versions of ACIS to return the same results.
 * <br><br>
 * Currently, wire bodies and wires present in mixed-dimension bodies are not
 * supported. The default behavior is that any wires in the input bodies are
 * ignored, but this can be changed, for example, for debug builds of applications, such
 * that the API will fail if any wires are present.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Degenerate cases:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If <tt>body_a</tt> and <tt>body_b</tt> point to the same entity, then a clash 
 *     result of <tt>CLASH_COINCIDENT</tt> will be returned. In this case, a list of entity clashes
 *     is not returned. However, note that if <tt>body_b</tt> points to an <em>exact
 *     copy</em> of <tt>body_a</tt>, then the same result will be returned, but entity
 *     clash data will also be generated.</li>
 * <li>If one or both of <tt>body_a</tt> and <tt>body_b</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, then a clash result
