// Header file describing the cone geometry entity.
//
// This describes a right elliptical cone, by specifying a
// cross-sectional ellipse, in the same form as for the ellipse curve,
// together with the sine and cosine of the major half-angle (i.e.
// the half-angle measured in the plane of the major axis of the ellipse).
//
// The CONE is defined by a cone which is given by a right elliptical
// cone recorded as a cross-sectional ellipse, in the same form as for
// the ellipse curve, together with the sine and cosine of the major
// half-angle (i.e. the half-angle measured in the plane of the major
// axis of the ellipse).
//
// The signs of the trigonometric functions disclose which way the
// cone is enlarging, and whether the surface is convex or concave. The
// rules are:
//	if cosine_angle is +ve, the surface direction is outwards,
//		away from the axis, so the surface is convex. Conversely
//		if cosine_angle is negative.
//	if sine_angle and cosine_angle have the same sign, then
//		the cone increases in cross-section in the direction of
//		the axis (the normal to the base ellipse), and conversely
//		if they have opposite sign.
// If sine_angle is 0, the "cone" is a cylinder, and the direction
// of increasing cross-section is meaningless. If cosine_angle is
// zero, the "cone" is planar, and neither convex nor concave. The
// outward normal is then simply minus the base normal multiplied by
// sine_angle.
//
// The surface stops at the apex (if any) - i.e. this surface type
// does not represent a double cone.

 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>CONE</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a (lowercase) <tt>cone</tt>,
 * the corresponding construction geometry class. In general, a model geometry class is derived
 * from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent model object. It provides model management
 * functionality, in addition to the geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>CONE</tt> is one of several classes derived from <tt>SURFACE</tt> to define a specific type of surface.
 * The <tt>cone</tt> class defines a cone by the base ellipse and the sine and cosine of the major half-angle.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>SURFACE</tt> and <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>CONE</tt> has member methods to provide
 * access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, methods are available to set
 * and retrieve the axes, center, and other information about a cone.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>CONE</tt>. The construction of a new <tt>CONE</tt>
