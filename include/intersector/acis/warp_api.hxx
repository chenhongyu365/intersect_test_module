 * Modifies an entity by bending it about a specified axis.
 * <br><b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Bending](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/e/n/t/Entity_Bending_c8f9.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The neutral root, bending axis, and bending direction together define
 * the neutral %plane for the bending operation.  The neutral %plane is the location
 * along which material is neither stretched nor compressed during bending&mdash;material
 * above the neutral %plane (along the bending direction) is compressed, while material
 * below the neutral %plane is stretched.  The choice of a neutral %plane will vary with
 * the type of material to be bent.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>neutral_root</tt> is a position that lies on the neutral %plane.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>bend_axis</tt> is a unit vector that defines the rotational axis
 * of the bend.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>bend_direction</tt> is an auxiliary unit vector that defines the
 * direction of the bend.
 * <br><br>
 * Together with the neutral root, the bending axis (<tt>ba</tt>) and bending direction
 * (<tt>bd</tt>) define a bending %plane whose normal is the vector <tt>ba x bd</tt>.
 * (The bending axis and bending direction should be perpendicular to one another.)
 * This cross product additionally defines the "positive" and "negative" sides of the
 * entity to be bent.  (As remarked below, the positive side is that which is bent during
 * fixed-end bending.)
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>radius</tt> is a real number that specifies the radius of the
 * bend, as measured from the center of the bend to the neutral %plane.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>angle</tt> is the angle, in radians, indicating the extent of
 * the bend.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>width</tt> is the width of bend region, as measured on the
 * neutral %plane.  Together, the values of <tt>radius</tt>, <tt>angle</tt>,
 * and <tt>width</tt> are used to determine the region to be bent.  Because only
 * two of these are independent, being related by
 * <tt>width = radius x angle</tt>, specifying <tt>width</tt>
 * can be considered optional.  More generally, assigning a zero angle or a non-positive
 * radius or width implies that the corresponding parameter is to be computed from the
 * other two.  Assigning meaningful values to all three generates an error.
 * If only <tt>radius</tt> is given a valid value, the entire entity is bent.
 * <br><br>
 * The flag <tt>f_center_bend</tt> (optional) specifies whether the desired bend is a
 * center bend or a fixed-end bend.  It controls the final orientation of the bend
 * entity.  When set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the material on both sides of the bending %plane
 * is equally bent by one-half the <tt>angle</tt> value.  When not set, or set to
 * <tt>FALSE</tt>, the negative side of the bend is fixed (that is, only the positive
 * side is bent by the specified angle).  This mode of bending is called fixed-end
 * bending.
 * <br><br>
 * For cases where localized bending is desired, the (optional) array of positions
 * <tt>bend_regions</tt> may be used to specify the portions of the entity to bend.
 * One or more positions can be provided.  These positions must be either within the
 * components to be bent, or on their faces.  The given positions are tested to
 * determine if they are within the bending region, and must lie on a face in order to
 * be used.  If any of the bend positions is invalid (outside the bending region or
 * outside the entity and its faces), no bending is performed.
 * <br><br>
 * If the width of the specified bend region is small, a bend may fail no matter how
 * small the bend angle.  Specifically, when this width is comparable to the tolerances
 * of nearby entities, it becomes impossible even to define such a region.

/**
 * Modifies a bent entity by rebending it about a specified axis, through a new angle.
 * <br><b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Entity Bending](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/e/n/t/Entity_Bending_c8f9.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The purpose of this API is to undo a bend and replace it by a similar
 * bend, only through a different angle.  If the new angle is set to zero, the bend
 * is merely undone, that is, flattened.  The parameter <tt>new_angle</tt> specifies
 * the new bend angle; all other parameters describe the bend being replaced, and are
 * maintained for the new bend except for <tt>radius</tt>, which is recomputed according
 * to <tt>radius = width/new_angle</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * <i>Note:</i> This API does not require the original bend to have been produced
 * using @href api_bend_entity, only that equivalent parameter values be provided as
 * input.
 * <br><br>
 * The neutral root, bending axis, and bending direction together define
 * the neutral %plane for the rebending operation.  The neutral %plane is the location
 * along which material is neither stretched nor compressed during bending&mdash;material
 * above the neutral %plane (along the bending direction) is compressed, while material
 * below the neutral %plane is stretched.  The choice of a neutral %plane will vary with
 * the type of material to be bent.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>neutral_root</tt> is a position that lies on the neutral %plane.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>bend_axis</tt> is a unit vector that defines the rotational axis
 * of the bend.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>bend_direction</tt> is an auxiliary unit vector that defines the

 * This cross product additionally defines the "positive" and "negative" sides of the
 * entity to be bent.  (As remarked below, the positive side is that which is bent during
 * fixed-end bending.)
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>radius</tt> is a real number that specifies the radius of the
 * bend, as measured from the center of the bend to the neutral %plane.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>old_angle</tt> is the angle, in radians, indicating the extent of
 * the original bend, while <tt>new_angle</tt> specifies the angle of the replacement
 * bend.
 * <br><br>
 * The argument <tt>width</tt> is the width of bend region, as measured on the
 * neutral %plane.  Together, the values of <tt>radius</tt>, <tt>old_angle</tt>,
 * and <tt>width</tt> are used to determine the region to be rebent.  Because only
 * two of these are independent, being related by
 * <tt>width = radius x old_angle</tt>, specifying <tt>width</tt>
 * can be considered optional.  More generally, assigning a zero angle or a non-positive
 * radius or width implies that the corresponding parameter is to be computed from the
 * other two.  Assigning meaningful values to all three generates an error.
 * If only <tt>radius</tt> is given a valid value, the entire entity is rebent.
 * <br><br>
 * The flag <tt>f_center_bend</tt> (optional) specifies whether the desired rebend is a
 * center bend or a fixed-end bend.  It controls the final orientation of the bend
 * entity.  When set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the material on both sides of the bending %plane
 * is equally bent by one-half the <tt>new_angle</tt> value.  When not set, or set to
 * <tt>FALSE</tt>, the negative side of the bend is fixed (that is, only the positive
 * side is bent by the specified angle).  This mode of bending is called fixed-end
 * bending.
 * <br><br>
 * The (optional) array of positions <tt>rebend_regions</tt> may be used to specify
 * the portions of the input entity to rebend.  (These positions must be either
 * within the components to be rebent, or on their faces.)  This input is only
 * necessary where localized rebending is desired, that is, when not everything
 * within the rebend region is to be rebent.  However, it may be thought desirable
 * to pass this array in all cases, as it is not always entirely clear which entities
 * lie within the rebend region described by the other parameters.  Note that the
 * given positions are tested to determine if they are within the rebend region; if
 * any is found to be invalid (outside the region or outside the entity and its
 * faces), no rebending is performed.
 * <br><br>
 * Rebending from an angle of <tt>2pi</tt> or greater is not supported, nor is
 * rebending a sheet body.  Furthermore, if the width of the specified bend region is small,
 * a rebend may fail no matter how small the rebend angle.  Specifically, when this width is
 * comparable to the tolerances of nearby entities, it becomes impossible even to define such

/**
 * Creates a twist within a given region of a body about a specified axis and amount.
