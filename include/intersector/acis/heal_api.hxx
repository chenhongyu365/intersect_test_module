 * The API attempts to tighten gaps in the BODY that are bigger than the supplied

 * <b>Technical Article:</b> <i>[Tightening Gaps](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/t/i/g/Tightening_Gaps_3413.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> The API attempts to tighten gaps in the <tt>BODY</tt> that are
 * bigger than supplied <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt> value. A user is encouraged
 * to set the <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt> value to the desired manufacturability
 * tolerance of the user application.<br>
 * The API uses the relevant existing algorithms of geometry building
 * for tightening gaps. For more details, refer to the "Tightening Gaps"
 * technical article in the "Healing Component" section.<br>
 * An <tt>EDGE</tt> is said to have a gap bigger than <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>
 * value when its underlying <tt>curve</tt> does not lie on all its topologically
 * adjoining <tt>surface</tt>s within <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>. Similarly,
 * a <tt>VERTEX</tt> is said to have a gap bigger than <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>
 * value when it does not lie on all its topologically adjoining <tt>curve</tt>s
 * and <tt>surface</tt>s within <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>. In order to
 * tighten such gaps the API might have to make modifications to the geometry of
 * <tt>FACE</tt>s, <tt>EDGE</tt>s and <tt>VERTEX</tt>s.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * <b>Problem reporting by <tt>api_tighten_gaps:</tt></b><br>
 * In case the API is not able to tighten some of the <tt>EDGE</tt>s/<tt>VERTEX</tt>s
 * within <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>, then <tt>outcome</tt> of the API, will
 * contain <tt>error_info</tt> objects reporting problem <tt>COULD_NOT_TIGHTEN_GAP</tt>.
 * These <tt>error_info</tt> objects can be obtained by calling
 * <tt>outcome::get_error_info_list()</tt>. Each such <tt>error_info</tt>
 * object will also contain a pointer to the respective <tt>EDGE</tt>/<tt>VERTEX</tt>
 * associated with the problem.<br>
 * This API has failsafe behavior. This means that if <tt>outcome::encountered_errors()</tt>
 * returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, and <tt>outcome::ok()</tt> returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, then
 * it means that the API has encountered error(s), yet it proceeded further
 * successfully. In this case, the <tt>BODY</tt> is not guaranteed to be usable
 * for further modelling operations.<br>
 * For more details on problem reporting and failsafe behavior, refer to the
 * documentation of <tt>outcome</tt> and "Failsafe Behavior" technical
 * article in the "Kernel Component".<br><br>
 *
 * <b>Errors:</b><br>
 * <tt>INVALID_DESIRED_GAP_TIGHTNESS</tt> : Desired gap tightness less than
 * SPAresabs.<br>
 * <tt>WIRE_BODY_NOT_SUPPORTED</tt> : Wire body not supported<br>
 * <br><br>
 *
 * <b>Limitations:</b><br>
 * 1) The API cannot be guaranteed to tighten every gap within the
 * <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt> value provided by the user. All the existing
 * limitations of "Geometry Building" will hold. For more details on limitations
 * of "Geometry Building", refer to [Healing Limitations](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/h/e/a/Healing_Limitations_da4e.html)technical article.<br>
 * 2) In order to tighten the gaps in a region of a <tt>BODY</tt> within
 * <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt> value, the API may have to modify the geometry
 * in the surrounding regions even though some of the gaps may be already tight
 * within user supplied <tt>desired_gap_tightness</tt>.<br>
 * 3) The API is not supported on wires.<br><br>
 *
 * <b>Effect:</b><br>
 * In addition to modifying the geometry for tightening gaps, the API may have
 * to do the following other changes in the model in order to return back a valid
 * <tt>BODY</tt>.<br>
 * 1) Removal of sliver geometry that interfere with the surrounding valid
 * geometry.<br>
 * 2) splitting <tt>EDGE</tt>s at convexity points.
