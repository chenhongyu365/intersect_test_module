 * <i>[Sweeping with Options](http://doc.spatial.com/articles/s/w/e/Sweeping_with_Options_7371.html)</i>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API sweeps along a planar or nonplanar path, and
 * implements the combined functionality of many obsolete APIs. Refer
 * to the file <tt>scm/scmext/smoke/sweep_examples_scm.cpp</tt> 
 * for C++ examples illustrating the <tt>sweep_with_options</tt> 
 * functionality.
 * <br><br>
 * Sweep options can be set through the @href sweep_options class. 
 * The class has data fields representing all of the options that can be 
 * performed while sweeping. The data structure within this class establishes 
 * default values that can be used if no special sweep options are desired.
 * If sweep options are desired, the methods of this class can be used to
 * populate the data fields.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>api_sweep_with_options</tt> function has four overloaded instances:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Sweep a distance.</b> </li>
 * <li> <b>Sweep around an axis.</b> </li>
 * <li> <b>Sweep along a vector.</b> </li>
 * <li> <b>Sweep along an edge or a wire.</b> </li>
 * </ul>
 * This signature sweeps the profile along an edge or a wire. The arguments are the profile, 
 * a pointer to an entity (the path), the sweep options, and a pointer to the new body.
 * <br><br>
 * The first argument to the <tt>api_sweep_with_options</tt> function is a profile
 * in the form of a pointer to an entity. For example, an <tt>EDGE</tt> or a <tt>FACE</tt>, which
 * may or may not belong to a body, could form the sweeping profile. A planar
 * sheet body, containing non-adjacent faces is also permissible. The API will
 * sweep each face in the sheet body along the specified path with one call to
 * the function.
 * <br><br>
 * This API will also accepts a profile in the form of a branched wire body.
 * If the solid option is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, the API will sweep each edge of
 * the wire body along the specified path creating a sheet body. If the solid
 * option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, the API will cover a closed combination of edges where
 * possible. Faces resulting from covering will result in solid portions of a
 * new mixed body.
 * <br><br>
 * The next argument is a path. The path may take the form of an <tt>EDGE</tt>
 * pointer or a <tt>BODY</tt> pointer that contains only one non-branched wire. In this 
 * case, the API splits the path curve internally at all non-G<sup>1</sup> discontinuities
 * before the profile is swept. 
 * <br><br>
 * All other inputs are passed to the API through an instance of the <tt>sweep_options</tt>
 * class. The API creates and returns a body if the input profile does not already
 * belong to a body. What is returned depends on the type of profile:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Face belonging to a Body:</b> When the profile is part of a body, the result of the 
 *      sweep is returned as that
 *      body. The owning body is altered and <tt>new_body</tt> points to <tt>NULL</tt>. </li>
 * <li> <b>Face not belonging to a Body:</b> When the profile is a face not already belonging to a
 *      body (a separate face or
 *      edge), a new body is created and returned in the <tt>new_body</tt> argument. The face could 
 *      be deleted or relocated inside the new body. </li>
 * <li> <b>Wire Body:</b> When the profile is a wire body, the owning body is altered and 
 *      <tt>new_body</tt> points to <tt>NULL</tt>. The altered body can be either a solid or a sheet body
 *      depending on whether or not the option to make a solid has been set, and whether
 *      or not the wire body was closed. It is neither necessary nor desired that the
 *      wires be covered. The default is to make a solid if the wire body is closed. </li>
 * <li> <b>Edge not belonging to a Body:</b> When the profile is an edge or set of independent edges,
 *      a new body is created and returned in the <tt>new_body</tt> argument.
 *      The edge remains in the model and can be deleted or used for something else.
 *      If the edge is closed, by default it makes a solid body, otherwise it makes a
 *      sheet body. It is neither necessary nor desired that the edges be covered. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Exceptions:</b> When using the <tt>to_face</tt> option, the result of the sweep will be
 * returned in the <tt>new_body</tt> argument. The face set as the <tt>to_face</tt> will remain.
 * <br><br>
 * When using the <tt>sweep_to_body</tt> option, the result of the sweep will be returned in
 * the <tt>new_body</tt> argument. The pointer to the <tt>new_body</tt> will be the same address as
 * the body being swept to. The body being swept to will be deleted. If you wish to
 * keep that body, you must first make a copy of it. If you wish to unite the sweep
 * and the body being swept to, use the <tt>bool_type</tt> option set to <tt>UNITE</tt> to keep the
 * result as one body.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> This API does not guarantee that the body will not be self-intersecting 
 * for certain paths or for certain conditions in sweeping with draft or scale.
 * However, this API does gurantee that individual surfaces will not be self-intersecting if 
 * the sweep option <tt>self_int_test</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>. 
 * If you want to avoid self-intersecting bodies, then set the global option <tt>careful</tt> to <tt>TRUE</tt>; 
 * more checking will be done at the expense of performance.
 * For profiles that are not perpendicular to the path, and for profile edges that collapse 
 * during sweeping, this API may fail to give correct results.
 * For sweeping with scale, API expects profile to be planar and perpendicular to the path start.

/**
 * Extrudes a planar face or set of faces by a distance.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>api_extrude_planar_faces</tt> uses a highly efficient, but
 * somewhat restrictive, algorithm to extrude a planar face or a set of faces by a distance.
 * This algorithm requires the input entity to meet specific conditions (described
 * below under Limitations) but for efficiency does not check that the input entity 
 * meets these conditions. This algorithm also does not produce annotations. It is 
 * simply a highly efficient algorithm to extrude faces. 
 * <br><br>
 * If the input is a face that belongs to a body, the new faces will be added 
 * to the shell containing the face in the existing body. This must be the only 
 * face in this shell. If the input is a stand-alone face (that does not belong 
 * to a body), a new body, lump, and shell will be constructed to contain the 
 * returned faces. If the input is a body, each lump of the body must have one 
 * shell. If the shell contains a single face it will be swept as described above. 
 * If the shell contains multiple connected faces, the faces are swept simultaneously. 
 * <br><br>
 * Extrusions can be performed with a draft angle provided the resulting geometry is
 * analytic. This imposes additional restrictions on the input data which are described
 * in Limitations. The draft angle is specified using an extrusion options object. If 
 * an extrusion is performed with a draft angle, it is possible to perform a check
 * for self-intersecting geometry. This is specified using the extrusion options
 * object and it significantly impacts performance. Generally speaking, extrusions
 * should be specified that do not self-intersect and do not need to be checked for
 * self-intersections.
 * <br><br>
 * Extrusions also support the propagation of <tt>ATTRIB_CELL_PRECEDENCE</tt> attributes.
 * More specifically, cellular topology should be attached to the input sheet faces
 * with the <tt>cell_granularity</tt> option set to <tt>"face"</tt>, which will attach
 * a 2D cell to each sheet face. If <tt>ATTRIB_CELL_PRECEDENCE</tt> attributes are added
 * to these 2D cells, the attributes will propagate to the resulting 3D cells when the 
 * faces are extruded.
 * <br><br>
 * <dl>
 * <b>Errors:</b> Pointer to entity is <tt>NULL</tt> or not to a face or body.
 * <dd>&nbsp;Distance not greater than zero.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <b>Limitations:</b> When extruding an isolated face:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The input face or body must pass all checks at check_level 20. </li>
 * <li> The distance must be positive; i.e., 
 *      the extrusion is in direction of face normal. </li>
 * <li> The face can contain no non-manifold vertices. </li>
 * <li> The geometry of the face must be a plane. </li>
 * <li> The geometry of all the edges must be either straights or circular or 
 *      elliptical arcs. </li>
 * <li> None of the edges or vertices can be tolerant. </li>
 * <li> Each loop of the face must be closed. </li>
 * <li> Each loop of the face must enclose a finite area. </li>
 * <li> Each edge must have precisely one coedge; that is, 
 *      each edge must be a free edge. </li>
 * <li> The graph of edges can contain no branches; therefore, 
 *      there are no spur edges. </li>
 * <li> If the input entity is a face that is owned by a body, 
 *      and the owning body contains other faces or wires, 
 *      they cannot be connected to the input face and cannot intersect 
 *      with the extruded volume.  </li>
 * </ul>
 * When extruding a connected set of single-sided or double-sided faces: 
 * <ul>
 * <li> The faces can be either single-sided or double-sided; that is, 
 *      the set of faces forms either a sheet or an open, solid shell. </li>
 * <li> Each face must meet the requirements listed above for a single face, 
 *      with the following two exceptions: </li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>   An edge may have two coedges, 
 *        but the coedges must be on two different faces. </li>
 * <li>   A graph of edges can have branches, but spur edges are not allowed. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <li> The faces of the input body must have consistent face normal directions. </li>
 * <li> Each lump of the input body must have a single shell - and contain no wires, 
 *    just the planar sheet. </li>
 * <li> The input body contains no non-manifold vertices. </li> 
 * </ul>
 * When extruding with a draft angle:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The input must consist of a single face, or if there is more than one face,
 *      each face must be in a separate shell. </li>
 * <li> The draft angle and extrusion distance must be chosen such that the resulting
 *      lateral faces do not self-intersect and the topology of the top face is 
 *      the same as the bottom face.  That is, edges do not disappear and the connectivity
 *      of edges on the top face is the same as the connectivity of edges on the bottom 
 *      face. </li>
 * <li> The resulting geometry must consist entirely of analytic curves and surfaces.
 *      This implies that the edge geometry must consist entirely of straights and circles.
 *      In addition, circular edges must meet adjacent edges with tangent continuity. </li> 
 * </ul>
