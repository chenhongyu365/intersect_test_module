// There is a problem in that sometimes the edge alone is not enough to
// decide where the blend surface goes; it could go either side of the
// edge (cf. a straight line above a planar surface, with the line
// direction in the plane). These cases are disambiguated by the blend
// attribute supplying some kind of starting point for the ball, either
// rough or exact.

// Firstly, an enum to record the sense of the spring curve along the
// edge. For now, we allow 3 possibilities.
// 1. Forward. The spring curve moves always forwards along the edge,
// possibly with momentary stationary points.
// 2. Reversed. Always going backwards along the edge, possibly with
// momentary stationary points.
// 3. Stationary. The spring curve is actually a point on the edge and
// does not move at all along it. Note that a further field,
// edge_stat_cw, indicating the direction of the pivotting about the
// edge, MUST also be set in this case.
// 4. Unset, meaning not yet set. Geometry construction MUST set it.

// REMEMBER that virtually all the functions in this class are used by
// the support_coedge class. So for example, if you mean the underlying
// edge write "edge()" and NOT "(EDGE *)entity()", and so forth.
