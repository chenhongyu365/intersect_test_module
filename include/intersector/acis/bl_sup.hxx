// Modification---
//
//  30-Aug-07 pvc   Added class bl_continuity_level and methods 
//                  lateral_continuity to support_entity.
//  21-May-04 puc   Made the support chain doubly linked.
//  20-Apr-04 syh	Added function to trim interferences, mostly to take care of
// 		periodic interferences while handling multiple cap sheet. 
//  28-Oct-03 puc   Part of the changes made for entity-entity coupling project,
//  Added a function to change the owning blend attribute of the 
//  support entity, this is required for situations where bi-blend
//  code creates a face and then transfers the ownership of the blend face to
//  the adjacent edge attribute.
//                  
//	24-Jan-97 DAP	New attribute based blend stage 2.
//	1 Apr 96  nvp 	Add function to set_spring_cur_sense
//	08-Mar-96 bd	Add acis.hxx include.
//	29-Dec-95 dap	Declared class v_bl_contacts instead of including
//			header file, removed include of cvc.hxx.
//	20-Dec-95 nvp	add on_support()
//
