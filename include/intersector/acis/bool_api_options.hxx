/**
 * @nodoc
 *
 * Class to hold coincidence information for a Boolean operation.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> A @href bool_match_info object supplies
 * information about a known or intended
 * coincidence between blank and tool entities.
 * <br><br>
 * The match information allows the caller to specify a pair of entities
 * which is known to be coincident <em>by construction</em>, whether the
 * entities are coincident according to the coincidence rules of ACIS or
 * not.  It is also possible to supply extra information about the nature of
 * the coincidence which may help to improve the performance of the
 * Boolean.
 * <br><br>
 * Each of the entities may be a face or an edge, in any combination: that is, it
 * is possible to specify tool-blank correspondences as face-face, face-edge,
 * edge-face, and edge-edge matches.
 * <br><br>
 * A match between a pair of entities indicates that the entities may be
 * regarded as coincident to the given tolerance.  An edge-edge match implies
 * that the faces around the tool edge intersect the faces around the blank
 * edge along the common curve of intersection.  An edge-face match implies
 * the faces around the tool edge intersect the blank face along the curve of
 * the edge, and similarly for a face-edge match.  A face-face match implies
 * that all the neighbors of the tool face intersect the blank face along a
 * curve coincident with the common edge of the faces, and similarly for the
 * neighbors of the blank face.  Although it is common for the faces
 * themselves to be coincident, it is not necessary for them to be coincident
 * in order to be matched, merely that the condition on the edges of the faces
 * is satisfied.
 * <br><br>
 * The tolerance indicates the level at which one expects the entities to be
 * coincident.  The default value is the prevailing value of
 * <tt>SPAresabs</tt> which is suitable for truly coincident entities.  If the
 * entities are not coincident according to the rules of ACIS coincidence, but
 * are intended to be coincident as far as the Boolean operation is concerned
 * (for example, there are two edge curves, one of which is an approximation
 * of the other), then this value should be an estimate of the tolerance at
 * which the entities are coincident.  The value may be an upper bound, but
 * should not be so loose as to cause clashes between these entities and
 * distinct adjoining entities.  Note that if this value is larger than the
 * prevailing value of <tt>SPAresabs</tt>, then any edge which is specified in
 * the match and which survives the Boolean will be converted to a tolerant
 * edge, even when a looser tolerance is not necessary.
 * <br><br>
 * The additional information consists of two parts: a type of interaction and
 * the type of overlap. The type of interaction of the match refers to the
 * induced intersections between adjoining entities. If the interaction type
 * is not unknown, then the intersections induced by the match are the only
 * intersections relevant to the Boolean. For example, an edge-face match
 * implies that both the incident faces of the edge meet the matched face
 * along the edge; the interaction type may be used to indicate that the
 * neighboring faces do not meet the matched face anywhere else. One may set
 * the type of interaction when other intersections exist, but these are
 * induced by another match which is also specified in the same set of
 * options.
 * <br><br>
 * If the interaction type is known, then the Boolean may be able to reduce
 * the number of intersection calculations it performs. Additionally, if one
 * specifies the overlap type (see @href bool_overlap_type for values) , then
 * further optimizations may be possible.

* <br><br>

* This is controlled by the <b>merge type</b> parameter. This parameter may have one of

* <li><b>On</b> - specifies that merging will be performed at the end of regularized Boolean operations.</li>
* <li><b>Off</b> - specifies that merging will not be performed at the end of regularized Boolean operations.</li>
* <li><b>Delayed</b> - specifies that merging will not be performed at the end of regularized Boolean operations;
