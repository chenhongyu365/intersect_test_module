 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>PLANE</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a (lowercase)
 * <tt>plane</tt>, the corresponding construction geometry class. In general, a model geometry
 * class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent model object. It
 * provides model management functionality, in addition to the geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>PLANE</tt> is one of several classes derived from <tt>SURFACE</tt> to define a specific type of
 * surface. The <tt>plane</tt> class defines a plane by a point on the plane and its unit normal.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>SURFACE</tt> and <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>PLANE</tt> has member methods to
 * provide access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, methods are
 * available to set and retrieve the root point and normal of a plane.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>PLANE</tt>. The construction of a new <tt>PLANE</tt>
 * initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement the
 * use count, and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
