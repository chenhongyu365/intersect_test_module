/**
 * Defines a generic curve as an object in the model.
 * <br>
 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>CURVE</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a (lowercase)
 * curve, the corresponding construction geometry class. In general, a model geometry
 * class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent model object. It provides
 * model management functionality, in addition to the geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * The <tt>CURVE</tt> class provides the basic framework for the range of curve geometries
 * implemented at any time in the modeler. Additional classes are derived from <tt>CURVE</tt> to
 * define specific types of curves, such as <tt>COMPCURV</tt>, <tt>ELLIPSE</tt>, <tt>INTCURVE</tt>, and <tt>STRAIGHT</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>CURVE</tt> has member methods to provide
 * access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, a curve can be
 * transformed by a given transform operator.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>CURVE</tt>. The construction of a new
 * <tt>CURVE</tt> initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement
 * the use count, and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
 * @see ENTITY, EDGE, PCURVE, TCOEDGE
