 * a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent
 * model object. It provides model management functionality, in addition to the
 * geometry definition.
 * <br><br>
 * A <tt>SURFACE</tt> provides the basic framework for the range of surface geometries
 * implemented in the modeler. Additional classes are derived from <tt>SURFACE</tt> to
 * define specific types of surfaces, such as <tt>CONE</tt>, <tt>MESHSURF</tt>,
 * <tt>PLANE</tt>, <tt>SPHERE</tt> and <tt>TORUS</tt>.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>SURFACE</tt> has member
 * methods to provide access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example,
 * a surface can be transformed by a given transform operator, resulting in another surface.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>SURFACE</tt>. The construction of a new
 * <tt>SURFACE</tt> initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and
 * decrement the use count, and after the use count returns to 0, the entity is deleted.
