// Header for SPLINE.

// A SPLINE, a class derived from SURFACE, records a parametric
// surface as a (lower-case) spline.  In turn a spline holds a
// pointer to a spl_sur and a logical denoting reversal of the
// sense of the stored surface.  A spl_sur contains a use-count
// (as does the SURFACE) and a pointer to the detailed parametric
// surface description.

 * <b>Role:</b> <tt>SPLINE</tt> is a model geometry class that contains a pointer to a

 * a model geometry class is derived from <tt>ENTITY</tt> and is used to define a permanent

 * <tt>SPLINE</tt> is one of several classes derived from <tt>SURFACE</tt> to define a specific type of

 * parametric surface description.
 * <br><br>
 * Along with the usual <tt>SURFACE</tt> and <tt>ENTITY</tt> class methods, <tt>SPLINE</tt> has member methods
 * to provide access to specific implementations of the geometry. For example, a spline
 * can be transformed, resulting in another surface. All access to the surface data is
 * through methods for the spline class.
 * <br><br>
 * A use count allows multiple references to a <tt>SPLINE</tt>. The construction of a new SPLINE
 * initializes the use count to 0. Methods are provided to increment and decrement the
