/**

 *	<li><tt> TOLERANT_STITCH </tt></li>
 *	<li><tt> EDGE_TOLERANT_STITCH </tt></li>

 * <ul>
 * <li> BODYs </li>
 * <li> free FACEs </li>
 * <li> EDGEs </li>

 * This API also takes an <tt>AcisOptions</tt> object as input. <br><br>
 * The output of this API is a list of bodies. This API returns an <tt>outcome</tt> object that contains information of errors and problems encountered 
 * while stitching. <br>
 * Refer to the <b>Parameters</b> section below for details of input and 
 * output parameters.
 * <br><br>
 * The behavior exhibited by the API in each of the three modes is as specified under :- <br><br>
 * <b> EXACT_STITCH </b> (Exact Stitching)
 * <br><br>
 * An <tt>exact_stitch_options</tt> object needs to be passed using the <tt>stitch_options argument</tt> for the API to operate in this mode.<br><br>
 * Under this mode, this API accepts only a list of 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>BODYs</tt> </li>
 *</ul> 
 * The API stitches edges that are coincident within <tt>SPAresabs</tt>. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b> TOLERANT_STITCH </b> (Tolerant Stitching)
 * <br><br>
 * A <tt>tolerant_stitch_options</tt> object needs to be passed using the <tt>stitch_options</tt> argument for API to operate in this mode.<br><br>
 * Under this mode, this API accepts a list of 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>BODYs</tt> </li>
 * <li> free <tt>FACEs</tt> </li>. 
 * <li> or a combination of both </li>.
 * </ul><br>
 * NOTE :- A free <tt>FACE</tt> is a <tt>FACE</tt> that is a top-level 
 * entity and has no owner. Note that free <tt>FACEs</tt> are not legal in ACIS, but this API still accepts 
 * them. However, we recommend that this API be passed only <tt>BODYs.</tt><br><br>
 * The API stitches edges that are close within the user specified tolerance. The <b>Maximum Stitch Tolerance</b> section elaborates the importance of the user
 * specified tolerance. <br><br>
 * Under this mode, the API:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * 		<li> Performs stitching based on the @href NM_PROCESSING_MODE set in <tt>tolerant_stitch_options</tt> object.
 *		<li> During manifold stitching, the API makes <tt>DOUBLE_SIDED</tt> faces for an output sheet body and <tt>SINGLE_SIDED</tt> faces for an output solid body.</li>
 *		<li> Refer the technical article for properties of output bodies during non-manifold stitching.
 *		<li> Detects coincident (back-to-back) and partially coincident faces during stitching. 
 * 			 This detection depends on the coincident face detection mode set in <tt>tolerant_stitch_options</tt> object. 
 *			 The <b>Coincident Face Detection</b> section elaborates the various coincident face detection modes.</li>
 *		<li> Removes zero-area faces lying in the regions that are likely to be stitched.</li>
 *		<li> Adjusts the orientation of faces by reversing the coedges in its loops. 
 *			This may be needed in order to have consistent face normal directions across adjacent 
 * 			faces and also to have face normals point away from material side in solids.</li>
 *		<li> Orients and rearranges shells to solve shell containments. A flag controls whether this API 
 *			is allowed to make void shells or not. The <b>Shell Containment Solving</b> section 
 *	 		elaborates on the behavior of this API.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>EDGE_TOLERANT_STITCH</b> (Restricted Tolerant Stitching) 
 * <br><br>
 * An <tt>edge_tolstitch_options</tt> object needs to be is passed using the <tt>stitch_options</tt> argument for API to operate in this mode.<br><br>
 * Under this mode, this API accepts a list of 
 * <ul> 
 * <li> <tt>EDGEs</tt> </li>
 * </ul><br>
 * Only the  <tt>EDGEs</tt> appearing in the list are chosen as candidates for stitching.<br><br>
 * While performing manifold sticthing, this API accepts only free <tt>EDGEs</tt>.  A free <tt>EDGE</tt> is an edge that is associated with only one <tt>FACE</tt> and hence, has only 
 * one <tt>COEDGE</tt>. Furthermore, the top-level owner of each given free <tt>EDGE</tt> should either be 
 * a free <tt>FACE</tt> or should be a <tt>BODY</tt>.<br><br>
 * While performing non-manifold stitching, this API accepts <tt>EDGEs</tt> that are associated with one or more <tt>FACE</tt>(s) .
 * <br><br>
 * The functional behavior of this API under this mode is the same as that in <tt>tolerant_stitch</tt> mode.<br><br>
 * There is just one subtle difference; in restricted tolerant stitching, adjustment of 
 * face normals and rearrangement of shells is controlled by a flag. By default, the face normals 
 * are adjusted so that the stitched model is not void. If you are confident that all the 
 * face normals on the incoming faces are already correct, then this functionality can be switched
 * off by using the flag. If this functionality is switched off, the flag to allow this API 
 * to make void shells will have no impact. This API will not change the orientation of the shells.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Shell Containment Solving</b>
 * <br><br>
 * @href api_stitch orients and rearranges the shells to solve shell containments. 
 * Refer to the topic <i>Shell Containment Solving</i> in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article
 * for details on how stitching rearranges shells in the body(s).<br>
 * A flag controls whether this API shall be allowed to make void shells or not. This API, by default,
 * is allowed to make void shells. If this API is not allowed to make void shells, then the 
 * output shall not contain void shells. All shells in the output will be peripheral shells. 
 * New bodies shall be made in this case, if required. For details on how to set this flag, 
 * refer to documentation of @href tolerant_stitch_options.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Caution:  </b>The shell solving mechanism assumes that every shell would either be completely 
 * inside or completely outside another shell. If shells partially intersect, then the output 
 * of the shell solving is unpredictable. Thus, if you are not sure if the shells are going to  
 * have a clean containment, then we advise that you disallow stitching from returning void shells.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Maximum Stitch Tolerance</b>
 * <br><br>
 * In <tt>TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> and <tt>EDGE_TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> mode, you can specify the maximum stitch tolerance 
 * value by setting the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter in the corresponding <tt>stitch_options</tt> object. 
 * For details of how to set this parameter, refer to documentation for @href tolerant_stitch_options.
 * <br><br>
 * Accepatable values of <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter:-<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>more than or equal to <tt>SPAresabs</tt>. </li>
 * </ul>
 * Unaccepatable values of <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter:-<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>less than <tt>SPAresabs</tt>. The API will fail with an error <tt>INVALID_STITCH_MAX_TOL</tt> and the state of the model will roll back to its 
 * initial state. </li>
 * </ul>
 * Recommended values of <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter:-<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Smaller than the minimum feature size and greater than the maximum gap to be stitched in the model.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Since the API removes edges that are smaller than  <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter, if the  max_stitch_tol value happens to be greater than the minimum 
 * feature size this API may remove edges that should have been kept. Also note that if that maximum gap is greater than the minimum feature size in the model, 
 * this API might face problems during stitching.<br><br>
 * If the max_stitch_tol is not set, the API internally uses heuristics to set up 
 * the necessary internally used stitch tolerances.
 * <br><br>
 * The only way to specify the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter to this API is through @href tolerant_stitch_options. 
 * In <tt>TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> and <tt>EDGE_TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> mode, this API internally uses heuristics to set up 
 * the necessary internally used stitch tolerances. For more details refer to the <i>Stitching Tolerances</i> 
 * portion of the <i>Healing Tolerances</i> documentation.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Coincident Face Detection</b>
 * <br><br>
 * This API detects coincident (back-to-back) and partially coincident faces during 
 * stitching. This detection depends on the coincident face detection mode set in 
 * <tt>tolerant_stitch_options</tt> or <tt>edge_tolstitch_options</tt> object passed to 
 * this API. The API is not guaranteed to detect all coincident faces. 
 * It detects coincident faces only if it encounters them in the process of stitching. The coincident faces are recorded and returned as coincident face clusters.<br><br>
 * For example, if face A is coincident with face B, and face A is coincident with face C, then faces A, B, C form one cluster. 
 * The exact methods to obtain the clusters of coincident faces can be found in the description of @href tolerant_stitch_options class.<br><br>
 * If api_stitch comes across a pair of coincident faces while attempting to stitch these faces along an edge, the behavior of the API in the three different modes is as given below
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP</tt> mode: Under this option, if @href api_stitch comes across a pair of coincident faces, 
 *			<ul>
 *			<li> The two faces are not stitched together along the edge. </li>
 *			<li> The coincident face pair is recorded internally and these are returned as one or more face-clusters each of which contains a 
 *			set of coincident faces detected during stitching. </li>
 *			<li> A warning of COINCIDENT_FACE is thrown. </li>
 *			<li> Once a coincident pair is detected and recorded, stitching continues. </li>
 *			</ul><br>
 *          Although coincident faces are not stitched to each other in this mode, the coincident faces may be stitched 
 *			independently to other faces. Hence, the coincident faces may ultimately belong to the same body after stitching. This can result in an invalid body. 
 *          You may obtain information about coincident faces after the first call to @href api_stitch and 	manage it appropriately. For more details, refer to the section 
 *			<i>Recommended Healing Workflow</i>.</li><br><br>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH</tt> mode: Under this option 
 *          <ul>
 *			<li> The two faces are stitched together along the edge. </li>
 *			<li> The coincident face pair is recorded internally and these are returned as one or more face-clusters each of which contains a 
 *			set of coincident faces detected during stitching. </li>
 *			<li> A warning of COINCIDENT_FACE is thrown.</li>
 *			<li> Once a coincident pair is stitched and recorded, stitching continues. </li>
 *			</ul><br>
 *			Because this produces back-to-back stitched faces or partially stitched faces,
 *			it is likely downstream ACIS operations will fail; therefore, this mode is strongly discouraged.</li><br><br>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode: Under this option 
 *			<ul> 
 *			<li> The API will immediately return with the error COINCIDENT_FACE.</li>
 *			<li> The state of the model is rolled back to the unstitched state.</li>
 *			</ul></li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * Nearly coincident faces are geometrically valid, but they could be indications of possibly 
 * unintended design. Stitching nearly coincident faces can produce sharp wedge-like shapes. 
 * Such faces are stitched but reported in the <tt>outcome</tt> as a "nearly coincident faces" problem 
 * encountered by this API. For more details, refer to the section <b>Coincident Faces Detection</b>. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Note: </b>For information on how <tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP</tt>, <tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH</tt>, and 
 * <tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> modes interact 
 * with <tt>careful</tt> global option, refer to the section <b>Failsafe Behavior</b> of this API.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Failsafe Behavior</b><br><br>
 * The API, @href api_stitch , has a failsafe behavior (for example, this API attempts to do as much as possible 
 * and not fail, even in cases when it encounters geometry and topology related errors). On an event 
 * of a recoverable error, this API undoes the current atomic transaction that failed due to this 
 * error, raises a sys_warning with the same error message, and proceeds further. <br>
 * The failsafe behavior of this API does not apply to "irrecoverable" errors, such as: 
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li><tt>INVALID_STITCH_MAX_TOL</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>COINCIDENT_FACES (in SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR mode)</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>INPUT_NOT_AN_EDGE </tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>EDGE_ALREADY_STITCHED</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>EDGE_HAS_NO_FACE</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>NOTHING_TO_STITCH</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>FACE_WITH_OWNER</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>UNACCEPTABLE_ENTITY </tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>IMPROPER_STITCH_OPTION</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>EDGE_HAS_FACE_WITH_NO_BODY</tt></li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * These errors tend to indicate a programmatic mistake in the parameters being passed into this API, 
 * rather than geometric or topological errors in the bodies being stitched. Note that the failsafe 
 * behavior can be switched OFF by <i>pushing</i> a value of <tt>TRUE</tt> onto the global option <tt>careful</tt> before calling 
 * @href api_stitch (and <i>popping</i> it after the call). When the failsafe behavior is switched off, 
 * this API will fail and roll back to its initial state when the first error is encountered.
 * <br><br>
 * Coincident faces detection by this API also has a failsafe behavior. This API will roll when 
 * coincident faces are detected and <tt>careful</tt> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>.<br> 
 * When <tt>careful</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, this API will behave as given:
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode - This API will roll and exit immediately.</li>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP and SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH</tt> modes - It will record the coincident face information 
 *			and continue stitching and roll the model back to its initial state before exiting. 
 *			This API keeps the model unstitched, but provides the coincident face information.</li>
 *
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * When the <tt>careful</tt> option is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, this API will behave as given:
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode - This API will roll the model back to its initial state.</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 *<b>Outcome of api_stitch and Problem Reporting</b><br><br>
 * You can determine the result of this API using the following:<br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li>If outcome::encountered_errors() returns <tt>FALSE</tt>, then this API has fully succeeded; that is, 
 *			errors were not encountered.</li>
 *		<li> If outcome::encountered_errors() returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, and outcome::ok() returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, then 
 *			this API has encountered error(s), yet it proceeded further successfully. 
 *			In this case, the bodies in the <tt>output_bodies</tt> list are not guaranteed to be usable for 
 *			further modelling operations.</li>
 *		<li>If outcome::ok() returns <tt>FALSE</tt>, then this API has failed and rolled the model back to 
 *			the state before this API was called.</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * This API puts information about any error or problem that it encounters during its operation into 
 * the <tt>outcome</tt> returned. For more details, refer to the documentation of @href outcome and the section 
 * <b>Failsafe Behavior</b>. This API reports following errors and problems:
 * <br><br>
 * <b> Errors</b>

 * <br>
 * <b>Problems</b>
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li>Nearly coincident faces</li>
 *</ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Limitations</b>
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li>In <tt>EXACT_STITCH</tt> mode, this API will operate only on <tt>BODYs</tt>.</li>
 *		<li>In <tt>TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> mode, this API will operate only on <tt>BODYs</tt> or free <tt>FACEs</tt>. 
 *			A free <tt>FACE </tt>is a <tt>FACE</tt> that is a top-level entity and has no owner. Note that free FACEs
 *			are not legal in ACIS, but this API still accepts them. It is recommended, however, that 
 *			this API be passed only <tt>BODYs.</tt></li>
 *		<li>In <tt>EDGE_TOLERANT_STITCH</tt> mode, this API will operate only on free <tt>EDGEs</tt>.
 *			A free <tt>EDGE</tt> is an edge that is associated with only one <tt>FACE</tt> and hence has only one <tt>COEDGE</tt>. Further the 
 *			top level owner of each given free or solid <tt>EDGE</tt> should either be a free <tt>FACE</tt>
 *			or should be a <tt>BODY.</tt></li>
 *		<li>If <tt>FACEs</tt> to be stitched are intended to become multiple partially or fully overlapping 
 *			<tt>BODYs</tt> (for example, connected parts in an assembly), the <tt>FACEs</tt> for each 
 *			<tt>BODY</tt> should be separately sent to this API. If all the <tt>FACEs</tt> are passed 
 *			together to this API, then the behavior of API is unpredictable. This holds true for all 
 *			modes of stitching.	</li>
 *		<li>During non-manifold stitching, this API does not handle sidedness and containment accurately. This API never marks any DOUBLE_SIDED face as BOTH_INSIDE. If you intend to stitch a model to make an internal partition 
 *			embedded in a solid, then although this API will stitch the faces, it will not get the containment correct. So such a stitched model will report check errors. 
 *			 In order to correct such a model, manually set the containment of the internal partition faces to BOTH_INSIDE.
 *		<li>If maximum gap is greater than the minimum feature size in the model, this API might face problems 
 *			during stitching. For details, refer to the section <b>Maximum Stitch Tolerance</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Effect:
 * </b><br> 
 * Changes model. This API may remove edges smaller than maximum
 * stitch tolerance and faces with zero area. This API may also split incoming
 * edges in the process of stitching.

/**
 * Performs tolerant, non-manifold stitching between parting faces and part bodies. This API 
 * specifically supports mold and die design processes.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Role:</b> This API performs non-manifold stitching between parting faces and primary bodies. 
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *	<li> This API accepts parting faces in the <tt>parting_faces</tt> list and primary bodies
 *		in the <tt>primary_bodies</tt> list. You can pass free FACEs or sheet BODYs (containing one or 
 *		more faces) as parting faces, although it is recommended that they be passed as 
 *		sheet BODYs (even if they contain single faces), because free FACEs are
 *		not legal in ACIS.</li>
 *	<li> This API performs manifold and non-manifold stitching among the parting faces.</li>
 *	<li> This API performs manifold and non-manifold stitching between the parting faces and the primary bodies.</li>
 *	<li> This API does not perform any stitching among the primary bodies or within any 
 *		given primary body; if entities that are intended to be primary bodies need to be stitched, 
 *		they should be stitched using @href api_stitch before calling <tt>api_stitch_nonmanifold</tt>. 
 *		The <tt>parting_faces</tt> list cannot be empty. If you supply an empty <tt>parting_faces</tt> list, 
 *		then the API reports back the error "Parting face list is empty". However, the <tt>primary_bodies</tt> list 
 *		may be empty, in which case the API proceeds to stitch only the parting faces.</li>
 *	</ul>
 * <br>
 * Refer to the topic <i>Non-manifold Stitching</i> in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article for an example of 
 * a primary body with its parting faces. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b> Maximum Stitch Tolerance </b> 
 * <br><br>
 * You can specify the maximum stitch tolerance value by setting the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> 
 * parameter in the <tt>tolerant_stitch_options</tt> object. For details on how to set this parameter, 
 * refer to the @href tolerant_stitch_options documentation.
 * <br><br>
 * You may set the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter to a value more than or equal to <tt>SPAresabs</tt>.
 * If you set the maximum stitch tolerance to a value less than <tt>SPAresabs</tt>, then the API will 
 * fail with an error INVALID_STITCH_MAX_TOL and the state of the model will roll back 
 * to its initial state. The only way to specify the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter to the API
 * is through @href tolerant_stitch_options. If you do not set any value in <i>max_stitch_tol</i>, 
 * then the API uses heuristics to choose a <i>max_stitch_tol</i> by itself. However, 
 * this choice may not be suitable to the entities being stitched. The API may remove small
 * (sliver) edges smaller than the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter. Hence you are strongly 
 * recommended to set the <i>max_stitch_tol</i> parameter to be smaller than the minimum feature 
 * size and greater than the maximum gap to be stitched in the model. Note that if maximum gap
 * is greater than the minimum feature size in the model, this API might face problems during stitching.
 * Refer to the topic <i>Stitching</i> in the Technical Articles 
 * for details on the internal tolerances used by the stitching algorithm.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Coincident Face Detection </b>
 * <br><br>
 * The API, @href api_stitch_nonmanifold , detects coincident (back-to-back) and partially coincident faces during 
 * stitching. This detection depends on the coincident face detection mode set in 
 * @href tolerant_stitch_options object. <tt>api_stitch_nonmanifold</tt> is not guaranteed to detect all coincident faces. 
 * It detects coincident faces only if it encounters them in the process of stitching.The detection and processing of the 
 * coincident faces by this API depends upon the mode set in @href tolerant_stitch_options object passed to 
 * this API. The behavior under different modes is as mentioned below: 
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP</tt> mode: Under this option, while attempting to stitch a pair of
 *			faces along an edge, if @href api_stitch_nonmanifold comes across a pair of coincident faces, it will not 
 *			stitch the two faces together along the edge, and stitching continues. The coincident 
 *			face pair is recorded internally, and this API throws a warning of COINCIDENT_FACE. 
 *			This API optionally returns a list of one or more face-clusters, each of which contains a 
 *			set of coincident faces detected during stitching. For example, if face A is coincident 
 *			with face B, and face A is coincident with face C, then faces A, B, C form one cluster. 
 *			The exact methods to obtain the clusters of coincident faces can be found in the 
 *			description of @href tolerant_stitch_options class.</li>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH</tt> mode: Under this option, while attempting to stitch a pair 
 *			of faces along an edge, if @href api_stitch_nonmanifold comes across a pair of coincident faces, it will 
 *			stitch the two faces together along the edge, and stitching continues. 
 *			The coincident face pair is recorded internally, and this API throws a warning of 
 *			COINCIDENT_FACE. This API optionally returns a list of one or more face-clusters, each of 
 *			which contains a set of coincident faces detected during stitching. For example, if face A
 *			is coincident with face B, and face A coincident with face C, then faces A, B, C form 
 *			one cluster. The exact methods to obtain the clusters of coincident faces can be found 
 *			in the description of the @href tolerant_stitch_options class. Because this produces back-to-back stitched faces,
 *			it is likely downstream ACIS operations will fail; therefore, this mode is strongly discouraged.</li>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode: Under this option, while attempting to stitch a pair 
 *			of faces along an edge, if @href api_stitch_nonmanifold comes across a pair of coincident faces, it 
 *			will immediately return with the error COINCIDENT_FACE. The state of the model is rolled 
 *			back to the unstitched state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Nearly coincident faces are geometrically valid, but they could be indications of possibly 
 * unintended design. Stitching nearly coincident faces can produce sharp wedge-like shapes. 
 * Such faces are stitched, but reported in the <tt>outcome</tt> as a "nearly coincident faces" problem 
 * encountered by this API. For more details, refer to the topic <i>Coincident Face Detection</i> 
 * in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Note</b>:  For information on how <tt> SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP, SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH and SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> modes interact 
 * with the <tt>careful</tt> global option, refer to the section <b>Failsafe Behavior</b> below.
 * <br><br> 
 * <b>Shell Containment Solving</b>
 * <br><br>
 * This API orients and rearranges the shells to solve shell containments. 
 * Refer to the topic <i>Shell Containment Solving</i> in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article
 * for details about how stitching rearranges shells in the body(s).
 * A flag controls whether this API is allowed to make void shells. This API, 
 * by default, is allowed to make void shells. If it is not allowed to make void shells,
 * then the output will not contain void shells. All shells in the output will be 
 * peripheral shells. New bodies will be made in this case, if required. For details 
 * on how to set this flag, refer to @href tolerant_stitch_options documentation.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Caution:</b> 
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li> The shell solving mechanism assumes that every shell would either be completely inside or completely
 * outside another shell. If shells partially intersect, then the output of shell solving
 * is unpredictable. If you are uncertain whether the shells will have 
 * a clean containment, then we advise that you disallow stitching from returning void 
 * shells. </li>
 * <li> This API marks all the faces of the incoming solid bodies <tt>SINGLE_SIDED</tt>. 
 * The faces of the incoming sheet bodies are marked <tt>DOUBLE_SIDED</tt> with containment 
 * as <tt>BOTH_OUTSIDE</tt>. Refer to the section <b>Limitations</b> below.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Failsafe Behavior</b>
 * <br><br>
 * The API, @href api_stitch_nonmanifold , has a failsafe behavior (for example, this API will attempt to do as much as possible 
 * and not fail, even in cases when it encounters geometry and topology related errors). On an event 
 * of a recoverable error, this API will undo the current atomic transaction that failed due to this 
 * error, raise a sys_warning with the same error message, and proceed further. <br>
 * The failsafe behavior of this API does not apply to "irrecoverable" errors, such as:
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li><tt>INVALID_STITCH_MAX_TOL</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>COINCIDENT_FACES</tt> (in <tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode)</li>
 *		<li><tt>INPUT_NOT_AN_EDGE </tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>NOTHING_TO_STITCH</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>FACE_WITH_OWNER</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>UNACCEPTABLE_ENTITY </tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>IMPROPER_STITCH_OPTION</tt></li>
 *		<li><tt>PARTING_FACE_LIST_EMPTY</tt></li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * These errors tend to indicate a programmatic mistake in the parameters being passed into this API, 
 * rather than geometric or topological errors in the bodies being stitched. Note that the failsafe 
 * behavior can be switched OFF by <i>pushing</i> a value of <tt>TRUE</tt> onto the global option <tt>careful</tt> before calling 
 * @href api_stitch_nonmanifold (and <i>popping</i> it after the call). When the failsafe behavior is switched off, 
 * this API fails and rolls back to its initial state when the first error is encountered.
 * <br><br>
 * Coincident faces detection by this API also has a failsafe behavior. This API rolls when 
 * coincident faces are detected and the <tt>careful</tt> option is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>.<br> 
 * When <tt>careful</tt> is <tt>TRUE</tt>, this API behaves as given:
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode - This API rolls and exits immediately.</li>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_SKIP and SPASTITCH_COIN_STITCH</tt> modes - The API records the coincident face information, 
 *			continues stitching, and rolls the model back to its initial state before exiting. 
 *			This API keeps the model unstitched, but provides the coincident face information. </li>
 *
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * When the <tt>careful</tt> option is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>, this API behaves as given:
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li><tt>SPASTITCH_COIN_ERROR</tt> mode - This API rolls the model back to its initial state.</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 *<b>Outcome of <tt>api_stitch</tt> and Problem Reporting</b>
 * <br><br>
 * You can determine the result of this API using the following:
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li>If outcome::encountered_errors() returns <tt>FALSE</tt>, then this API has fully succeeded; that is,  
 *			errors were not encountered.</li>
 *		<li> If outcome::encountered_errors() returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, and outcome::ok() returns <tt>TRUE</tt>, 
 *			this means that this API has encountered error(s), yet it proceeded further successfully. 
 *			In this case, the bodies in the <tt>output_bodies</tt> list are not guaranteed to be usable for 
 *			further modelling operations.</li>
 *		<li>If outcome::ok() returns <tt>FALSE</tt>, this API has failed and rolled the model back to 
 *			the state before this API was called.</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * This API puts information about any error or problem that it encounters during its operation into 
 * the outcome returned. For more details, refer to the @href outcome documentation and the section 
 * <b>Failsafe Behavior</b> above. This API reports the following errors and problems:
 * <br><br>
 *	<b> Errors</b>
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li>Coincident faces found</li>
 *		<li>Stitch max tol less than <tt>SPAresabs</tt></li>
 *		<li>Nonmanifold edges encountered</li>
 *		<li>Invalid topology encountered</li>
 *		<li>Unsupported topology encountered</li>
 *		<li>Nothing to stitch</li>
 *		<li>Improper stitch_option</li>
 *		<li>Encountered face with owner</li>
 *		<li>Top level owner of <tt>EDGE</tt> is neither a <tt>FACE</tt> nor a <tt>BODY</tt></li>
 *		<li>Shell not peripheral</li>
 *		<li>Shell reversal failed</li>
 *		<li>Shell containment check failed</li>
 *		<li>Shell orientation check failed</li>
 *		<li>Free face contains information of other faces</li>
 *		<li>Parting faces list is empty</li>
 *</ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Problems</b>
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 *		<li>Nearly coincident faces</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * <b>Limitations</b>
 * <br><br>
 *<ul>
 *		<li>This API operates only on BODYs or free FACEs. A free FACE is a FACE 
 *			that is a top-level entity and has no owner. Note that free FACEs are not 
 *			legal in ACIS, but this API still accepts them. We recommend, however, 
 *			that this API be passed only BODYs. </li>
 *		<li>This API does not support vertex stitching. Refer to the topic <i>Non-manifold Stitching</i> 
 *			in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article for an illustration.</li>
 *		<li>This API does not always handle sidedness and containment of faces 
 *			accurately. If a user provides sheet bodies (or free faces) in parting faces
 *			list and primary bodies list for non-manifold stitching, then all the faces
 *			of the stitched non-manifold body returned by this API might be marked 
 *			<tt>DOUBLE_SIDED</tt> with containment as <tt>BOTH_OUTSIDE</tt>, even if a portion of the 
 *			non-manifold body encloses finite volume. However, if the user provides one 
 *			or more solid bodies (with or without sheet bodies) in the primary bodies
 *			list to be stitched with parting faces list, then all the faces of the 
 *			incoming solid bodies will be marked <tt>SINGLE_SIDED</tt>. The faces of the incoming
 *			sheet bodies will be marked <tt>DOUBLE_SIDED</tt> with containment as <tt>BOTH_OUTSIDE</tt>.</li>
 *		<li>This API never marks any <tt>DOUBLE_SIDED</tt> face as <tt>BOTH_INSIDE</tt>. If you intend
 *			to stitch a model to make an internal partition embedded in a solid, then 
 *			although this API will stitch the faces, it will not get the containment correct. 
 *			So such a stitched model will report check errors. In order to correct such
 *			a model, manually set the containment of the internal 
 *			partition faces to <tt>BOTH_INSIDE</tt>. Refer to the topic <i>Non-manifold Stitching</i> 
 *			in the <i>Tolerant Stitching</i> Technical Article for an illustration.</li>
 *		<li>If maximum gap is greater than the minimum feature size in the model, this API might face problems 
 *			during stitching. For details, refer to the <b>Maximum Stitch Tolerance</b> section.</li>
 *		<li> The only acceptable non-manifold processing mode in tolerant_stitch_options for this API is NM_STITCH. The API will 
*            ignore the non-manifold processing mode in tolerant_stitch_options if set to NM_DETECT 
 *			 or NM_IGNORE. A warning will be issued for this and the API will continue with non-manifold stitching.</li>
 *</ul>
 *<br>
 * <b>Effect:
 * </b><br> 
 * Changes model. This API may remove edges smaller than maximum stitch tolerance. 
 * This API may also split incoming edges in the process of stitching.

 * 
 * @param output_bodies
 * This is an output argument. 
 * The output from this API is only bodies, which
