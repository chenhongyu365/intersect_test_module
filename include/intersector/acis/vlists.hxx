// Header for lists of void*.

// This class implements a variable-length list of void*'s.
// It provides a constructor (which creates an empty list) and
// destructor, functions to add an void* (only if not already there),
// and look one up by pointer value, and to count the number of
// void*'s listed.  Also provides an overloaded "[]" operator for
// access by SPAposition.

// The current implementation uses hashing so that look up is fast
// provided lists are not very long; it is also efficient for very
// short lists and for repeated lookups of the same void*.
